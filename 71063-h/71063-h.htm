<h2>Transcriber’s Notes</h2>

<p class='c009'>Inconsistent punctuation has been silently corrected.</p>

<p class='c009'>Obvious misspellings have been silently corrected, and the following
corrections made to the text. Other spelling and hyphenation variations
have not been modified.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<dl>
<dt>    <a href="#did">Page 12, section 23</a> </dt><dd> the did -> did the</dd>
<dt>    <a href="#can">Page 55, section 45</a> </dt><dd> can comesout -> can come out</dd>

<dt>    <a href="#grovel">Page 357, section 60</a> </dt><dd> and do not grove -> and do not grovel</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class='c009'>Angle brackets: &lt;...&gt; have been used by the transcriber to indicate light
editing of the text to insert missing words.
</p>
<p class='c009'>On <a href="#53">pages 88-89</a>, Section 53 is numbered twice. This has not been modified.
</p>

<p class='c009'>The spelling of Sanskrit words are normalized to some extent, including
correct/addition of accents where necessary.  Note that the author uses
á, í, ú to indicate long vowels. This notation has not been changed.
</p>

<p class='c009'>The Sanskrit words in Devanagari script in <a href="#f3">footnote 3</a> are unclear in the
original text. They are rendered here as a best guess by the transcriber.
</p>

<p class='c009'>The LPP edition (1999) which has been scanned for this ebook, is of
poor quality, and in some cases text was missing. Where possible, the
missing/unclear text has been supplied from another edition, which has
the same typographical basis (both editions are photographical reprints
of the same source, or perhaps one is a copy of the other): Bharatiya
Publishing House, Delhi 1978.</p>

<p class='c009'>A third edition, Parimal Publications, Delhi 1998, which is based on an
OCR scanning of the same typographical basis, has also been consulted.</p>

<p class='c009'>The term “Gloss.” or “Glossary” probably refers to the extensive classical
commentary to Yoga Vásishtha by Ananda Bodhendra Saraswati.
(Only available in Sanskrit).</p>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> said:—The loud cry that the king was killed
in battle by the rival monarch, struck the people with
awe, and filled the realm with dismay.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Carts loaded with utensils and household articles, were
driving through the streets; and women with their loud wailings,
were running away amidst the impassable paths of the city.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. The weeping damsels that were flying for fear, were
ravished on the way by their captors; and the inhabitants were
in danger of being plundered of their properties by one another.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. The joyous shouts of the soldiers in the enemy’s camp,
resounded with the roarings of loose elephants and neighings
of horses, trampling down the men to death on their way.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. The doors of the royal treasury were broken open by the
brave brigands, the valves flew off and the vaults re-echoed
to the strokes. The warders were overpowered by numbers,
and countless treasures were plundered and carried away.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Bandits ripped off the bellies of the royal dames in the
palace, and the chandála free-booters hunted about the royal
apartments.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. The hungry rabble robbed the provisions from the royal
stores; and the soldiers were snatching the jewels of the
weeping children trodden down under their feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Young and beautiful maidens were dragged by their hair
from the seraglio, and the rich gems that fell from the
hands of the robbers, glistened all along the way.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>9. The chiefs assembled with ardour with their troops of
horses, elephants and war-chariots, and announced the
installation of Sindhu by his minister.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. Chief engineers were employed in making the decorations
of the city and its halls, and the balconies were filled by
the royal party attending at the inauguration.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. It was then that the coronation of Sindhu’s son, took place
amidst the loud acclamations of victory; and titles and dignities,
were conferred upon the noblemen on the victor’s side.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. The royal party were flying for life into the villages,
where they were pursued by the victorious soldiers; and a
general pillage spread in every town and village throughout
the realm.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. Gangs of robbers thronged about, and blocked the passages
for pillage and plunder; and a thick mist darkened the
light of the day for want of the magnanimous Vidúratha.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. The loud lamentations of the friends of the dead, and the
bitter cries of the dying, mixed with the clamour raised by
the driving cars, elephants and horses, thickened in the air
as a solid body of sound (pindagráhya).</p>

<p class='c009'>15. Loud trumpets proclaimed the victory of Sindhu in every
city, and announced his sole sovereignty all over the earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. The high-shouldered Sindhu entered the capital as a second
Manu (Noah), for re-peopling it after the all-devastating
flood of war was over.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. Then the tribute of the country poured into the city of
Sindhu from all sides; and these loaded on horses and elephants,
resembled the rich cargoes borne by ships to the sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. The new king issued forthwith his circulars and royal
edicts to all sides, struck coins in his own name, and
placed his ministers as commissioners in all provinces.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. His iron-rod was felt in all districts and cities like
the inexorable rod of Yama, and it overawed the living with
fear of instant death.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. All insurrections and tumults in the realm, soon subsided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>to rest under his reign; as the flying dust of the earth
and the falling leaves of trees, fall to the ground upon
subsidence of a tempest.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. The whole country on all sides was pacified to rest,
like the perturbed sea of milk after it had been churned
by the Mandara mountain.</p>

<p class='c009'>22. Then there blew the gentle breeze of Malaya, unfurling
the locks of the lotus-faced damsels of Sindhu’s realm,
and wafting the liquid fragrance of their bodies around,
and driving away the unwholesome air (of the carnage).</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LII.<br> <br><span class="smcap">State of Man after Death.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> said:—In the meanwhile, O Ráma! Lílá seeing
her husband lying insensible before her and about
to breathe his last, thus spoke to Sarasvatí:
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Behold, O mother! my husband is about to shuffle his
mortal coil in this perilous war, which has laid waste his
whole kingdom.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Sarasvatí replied:—This combat that you saw to be fought
with such fury, and lasting so long in the field, was
neither fought in thy kingdom nor in any part of this earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. It occurred nowhere except in the vacant space of the
shrine, containing the dead body of the Bráhman; and where it
appeared as the phantom of a dream only (in your imagination).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. This land which appeared as the realm of thy living lord
Vidúratha, was situated with all its territories in the inner
apartment of Padma. (The incidents of Vidúratha’s life, being
but a vision appearing to the departed spirit of Padma).</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Again it was the sepulchral tomb of the Bráhman Vasishtha,
situated in the hilly village of Vindhyá, that exhibited these
varying scenes of the mortal world within itself. (<i>i.e.</i> As a
panorama shows many sights to the eye, and one man playing
many parts in the stage).</p>

<p class='c009'>7. As the departed soul views the vision of the past world within
its narrow tomb; so is the appearance of all worldly accidents
unreal in their nature. Gloss:—The apparitions appearing
before the souls of the dead lying in their tombs, are as
false as the appearances presenting themselves before the living
souls in their tomb of this world. The souls of the living and
the dead are both alike in their nature, and both susceptible of
the like dreams and visions.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. These objects that we see here as realities, including
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>these bodies of mine and thine and this Lílá’s, together with
this earth and these waters, are just the same as the phantoms
rising in the tomb of the deceased Bráhman of the hilly region.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. It is the soul which presents the images of things, and
nothing external which is wholly unreal can cast its reflexion
on the soul. Therefore know thy soul as the true essence which
is increate and immortal, and the source of all its creations
within itself. Note:—The subjective is the cause of the objective
and not this of that.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. The soul reflects on its inborn images without changing
itself in any state, and thus it was the nature of the Bráhman’s
soul, that displayed these images in itself within the sphere of
his tomb.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. But the illusion of the world with all its commotion,
was viewed in the vacant space of the souls of the Bráhman and
Padma, and not displayed in the empty space of their tombs,
where there was no such erroneous reflexion of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. There is no error or illusion anywhere, except in the
misconception of the observer; therefore the removal of the fallacy
from the mind of the viewer, leads him to the perception of the
light of truth.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. Error consists in taking the unreal for the real, and in
thinking the viewer and the view or the subjective and objective
as different from each other. It is the removal of the distinction
of the subjective and objective, that leads us to the
knowledge of unity (the <i>on</i> or one or <i>om</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>14. Know the Supreme soul to be free from the acts of
production and destruction, and it is his light that displays
all things of which He is the source; and learn the whole outer
nature as having no existence nor change in itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. But the souls of other beings, exhibit their own natures
in themselves; as those in the sepulchral vault of the Bráhman,
displayed the various dispositions to which they were accustomed.
(Thus the one unvaried soul appears as many, according
to its particular wont and tendency in different persons).</p>

<p class='c009'>16. The soul has no notion of the outer world or any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>created thing in it; its consciousness of itself as an increate
vacuity, comprehends its knowledge of the world in itself. (<i>i.e.</i>
The subjective consciousness of the Ego, includes the knowledge
of the objective world).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. The knowledge of the mountain chains of Meru and others,
is included under the knowledge in the vacuity of the
soul; there is no substance or solidity in them as in
a great city seen in a dream.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. The soul views hundreds of mountainous ranges and
thousands of solid worlds, drawn in the small compass
of the mind, as in its state of dreaming.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. Multitudes of worlds, are contained in a grain of the
brain of the mind; as the long leaves of the plantain tree,
are contained in one of its minute seeds.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. All the three worlds are contained in an atom as the
intellect, in the same manner as great cities are seen in a dream;
and all the particles of intellect within the mind, have each the
representation of a world in it.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. Now this Lílá thy step-dame, has already gone to the
world which contains the sepulchre of Padma, before the
spirit of Vidúratha could join the same.</p>

<p class='c009'>22. The moment when Lílá fell in a swoon in thy presence,
know her spirit to be immediately conveyed to him and placed
by his side.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. Lílá asked:—Tell me, O goddess! how was this lady
endowed here with my form before, and how is she translated
to and placed as my step-dame beside my deceased husband?</p>

<p class='c009'>24. Tell me in short, in what form she is now viewed by the
people in Padma’s house, and the manner in which they are
talking to her at present.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. The goddess replied:—Hear Lílá, what I will relate to
thee in brief in answer to thy question, regarding the life
and death of this Lílá as an image of thyself.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. It is thy husband Padma, that beholds these illusions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>the world spread before him in the same sepulchre in the person
of Vidúratha.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. He fought this battle as thou didst see in his reverie,
and this Lílá resembling thyself was likewise a delusion. These
his men and enemies were but illusions, and his ultimate death,
was as illusory as a phantom of the imagination, like all other
things in this world.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. It was his self delusion, that showed him this Lílá
as his wife, and it is the same deceit of a dream, which
deludes thee to believe thyself as his consort.</p>

<p class='c009'>29. As it is a mere dream that makes you both to think
yourselves as his wives, so he deems himself as your husband,
and so do I rely on my existence (also in a like state of dream).</p>

<p class='c009'>30. The world with all its beauty, is said to be the spectre of
a vision; wherefore knowing it a mere visionary scene, we must
refrain from relying any faith in this visible phantasmagoria.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. Thus this Lílá, yourself and this king Vidúratha, are but
phantoms of your fancy: and so am I also, unless I believe
to exist in the self-existent spirit.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. The belief of the existence of this king and his people,
and of ourselves as united in this place, proceeds from the
fulness of that intellect, which fills the whole plenitude.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. So this queen Lílá also situated in this place with her
youthful beauty, and smiling so charmingly with her blooming
face, is but an image of divine beauty.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. See how gentle and graceful are her manners, and how very
sweet is her speech; her voice is as dulcet as the notes of the
Kokila, and her motions as slow as those of a lovelorn maiden.</p>

<p class='c009'>35. Behold her eyelids like the leaves of the blue lotus, and her
swollen breasts rounded as a pair of snow-balls; her form is as bright
as liquid gold, and her lips as red as a brace of ripe <i>Vimba</i> fruits.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. This is but a form of thee as thou didst desire to be to
please thy husband, and it is the very figure of thy ownself,
that thou now beholdest with wonder.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>37. After the death of thy husband, his soul caught the same
reflexion of thy image, as thou didst desire to be hereafter; and
which thou now seest in the person of the young Lílá before thee.</p>

<p class='c009'>38. Whenever the mind has a notion or sensation or fancy
of some material object, the abstract idea of its image
is surely imprinted in the intellect.</p>

<p class='c009'>39. As the mind comes to perceive the unreality of material
objects, it thenceforth begins to entertain the ideas of their
abstract entities within itself. (Hence the abstract ideas of
things are said to accompany the intellectual spirit after its
separation from the body).</p>

<p class='c009'>40. It was the thought of his sure death, and the erroneous
conception of the transmigration of his soul in the body of
Vidúratha, that represented to Padma thy desired form of the
youthful Lílá, which was the idol of his soul. (This passage
confutes the doctrine of metempsychosis, and maintains the
verity of eternal ideas).</p>

<p class='c009'>41. It was thus that thou wast seen by him and he was beheld
by thee according to your desires; and thus both of you
though possest of the same unvaried soul which pervades all
space, are made to behold one another in your own ways
(agreeably to your desires).</p>

<p class='c009'>42. As the spirit of Brahma is all pervasive, and manifests
itself in various ways in all places; it is beheld in different
lights, according to the varying fancies (vikshepa sakti); or
tendencies (vásaná sakti) of men, like the ever-changeful scenes
appearing to us in our visions and dreams.</p>

<p class='c009'>43. The omnipotent spirit displays its various powers in all
places, and these powers exert themselves everywhere, according
to the strong force and capability it has infused in them (in
their material or immaterial forms).</p>

<p class='c009'>44. When this pair remained in their state of death-like
insensibility, they beheld all these phantoms in their inner
souls, by virtue of their reminiscence and desires (which are
inherent in the soul).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>45. That such and such person were their fathers and such
their mothers before, that they lived in such places, had
such properties of theirs, and did such acts erewhile
(are reminiscences of the soul).</p>

<p class='c009'>46. That they were joined together in marriage, and the
multitude which they saw in their minds, appeared to them
as realities for the time in their imagination (as it was
in a magic show).</p>

<p class='c009'>47. This is an instance that shows our sensible perceptions, to
be no better than our dreams; and it was in this deluded state
of Lílá’s mind, that I was worshipped and prayed by her:—</p>

<p class='c009'>48. In order to confer upon her the boon that she might not
become a widow; and it was by virtue of this blessing of
mine, that this girl had died before her husband’s death
(to escape the curse of widowhood).</p>

<p class='c009'>49. I am the progeny of Brahmá, and the totality of that
intelligence of which all beings participate: it is for
this reason that I was adored by her as the <i>Kula Devi</i> or
tutelar divinity of all living beings.</p>

<p class='c009'>50. It was at last that her soul left her body, and fled with
her mind in the form of her vital breath, through the orifice
of her mouth.</p>

<p class='c009'>51. Then after the insensibility attendant upon her death
was over, she understood in her intellect her living soul
to be placed in the same empty space with the departed
spirit of Padma.</p>

<p class='c009'>52. Her reminiscence pictured her in her youthful form, and
she beheld herself as in a dream, to be situated in the same
tomb. She was as a blooming lotus with her beautiful countenance,
and her face was as bright as the orb of the moon; her eyes were
as large as those of an antelope, and she was attended by her
graceful blandishments for the gratification of her husband.</p>

Argument. Description of Lílá’s passage in the air, and her
union with her husband’s spirit. Relation of the depravity of
those that are unacquainted with and unpractised in Yoga.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> said:—Lílá having obtained the blessing of
the goddess, proceeded with her fancied body to meet her
royal spouse in heaven beyond the skies.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Having assumed her spiritual form which was as light
as air, she fled merrily as a bird; and was wafted aloft
by the fond desire of joining with her beloved lord.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. She met before her a damsel sent by the goddess of
wisdom, and as issuing out of the best model of her
heart’s desire.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. The damsel said:—I am the daughter of thy friend
Sarasvatí, and welcome thee, O beauteous lady in this
place. I have been waiting here on thy way through the
sky in expectation of thee.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Lílá said:—Lead me, O lotus-eyed maid to the side
of my husband, as the visit of the good and great never
goes for nothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Vasishtha said:—The damsel replied, come let us go there;
and so saying, she stood before her looking forward on
her way.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Then proceeding onward both together, they came to
the door-way of heaven, which was as broad as the open palm
of the hand, and marked with lines as those in palmistry. (?).</p>

<p class='c009'>8. They passed the region of the clouds, and overstepped
the tracks of the winds; then passing beyond the orbit of
the sun, they reached the stations of the constellations.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. Thence they passed through the regions of air and water
(Indraloka), to the abodes of the gods and saints (Siddhas);
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>whence they went across the seats of Brahmá, Vishnu and Siva
to the great belt—of the universe.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. Their spiritual bodies pierced through its orifice, as
the humidity of ice water passes out of the pores of a tight
water-jar.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. The body of Lílá was of the form of her mind, which
was of the nature of its own bent and tenor, and conceived
these wanderings within itself (<i>i.e.</i>, the peregrinations of
Lílá were purely the workings of her own mind and inclination).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. Having traversed the spheres of Brahmá, Vishnu and
Siva, and crossed the limit of the mundane sphere, and
the environs of atmospheric water and air:—</p>

<p class='c009'>13. They found an empty space as spacious as the scope
of the great intellect, and impassable by the swift Garuda
(the eagle of Jupiter) even in millions of Kalpa ages.
(<i>i.e.</i> The unlimited space of the mind and vacuity).</p>

<p class='c009'>14. There they beheld an infinity of shapeless and nameless
worlds, scattered about as the countless fruits in a great
forest. (The Nebulae of unformed worlds).</p>

<p class='c009'>15. They pierced through the ambit of one of these orbs
before them, and passed inside the same as a worm creeps
in a fruit which it has perforated.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. This brought them back by the same spheres of Brahmá,
Indra and others, to the orb of the globe below the
starry frame.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. Here they saw the same country, the same city and the
same tomb as before; and after entering the same, they sat
themselves beside the corpse of Padma covered under the heap
of flowers.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. At this time Lílá lost the sight of the heavenly damsel, who
had been her companion erewhile, and who had now disappeared
from her sight like a phantom of her illusion.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. She then looked at the face of her husband, lying there
as a dead body in his bed; and recognized him as such by her
right discretion.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>20. This must be my husband, said she, ay my very husband,
who fell fighting with Sindhu, and has now attained this
seat of the departed heroes, where he rests in peace.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. I have by the grace of the goddess arrived here in
person, and reckon myself truly blest to find my husband
also as such (<i>i.e.</i>, resting here in his own figure).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. She then took up a beautiful <i>chauri</i> flapper in her
hand, and began to wave it over his body as the moon moves
in the sky over the earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. The waking Lílá asked:—Tell me, O goddess! in what
manner <a id="did"></a>did the king and his servants and hand-maids
accost this lady, and what they thought her to be.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. The goddess replied:—It was by our gift of wisdom to
them, that this lady, that king and those servants, found
themselves to partake of the one and same intellectual soul,
in which they all subsisted.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. Every soul is a reflection of the divine intellect, and
is destined by his fixed decree to represent the individual
souls to one another as refractions of the same, or as shadows
in a magic show (bhojakádrishta).</p>

<p class='c009'>26. Thus the king received his wife as his companion and queen,
and his servants as cognate with himself. (<i>i.e.</i> Partaking
of the same soul with his own).</p>

<p class='c009'>27. He beheld the unity of his soul with her’s and their’s,
and no distinction subsisting between any one of them. He was
astonished to find that there was nothing distinct in them
from what he had in himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. The waking Lílá said:—Why did not that Lílá meet
her husband in her own person, according to her request and
the boon that was granted to her?</p>

<p class='c009'>29. The goddess replied:—It is not possible for unenlightened
souls (as that of the young Lílá), to approach in person to
holy spirits (or their persons or places), which are visible and
accessible only to the meritorious, and unapproachable by gross
bodies as the sun light is inaccessible by a shadow.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>30. So it is the established law from the beginning of creation,
that intelligent souls can never join with dull beings and
gross matter, as truth can never be mixed up with falsehood.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. And so is that as long as a boy is prepossessed with his
notion of a ghost, it is in vain to convince him of the falsehood
of goblins as mere chimeras of his imagination.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. And as long as the feverish heat of ignorance rages
within the soul, it is impossible for the coolness of the
moon of intelligence to spread over it.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. So long also as one believes himself to be composed of a
corporeal body, and incapable to mount in the higher atmosphere,
it is no way possible to make him believe otherwise
(that he has an incorporeal nature in his soul and mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>34. But it is by virtue of one’s knowledge and discrimination,
and by his own merit and divine blessing, that he acquires
a saintly form (nature); wherewith he ascends to the higher
region, as you have done with this body of yours.</p>

<p class='c009'>35. As dry leaves of trees are burnt in no time by the
burning fire, so this corporeal body is quickly lost by
one’s assumption of his spiritual frame.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. The effect of a blessing or curse, on any one is no
other than his obtaining the state he desired or feared
to have. (Hence the boon of Lílá has secured to her what
she wished to get).</p>

<p class='c009'>37. As the false appearance of a snake in a rope, is attended
with no motion or action of the serpent in it; so the unreal
views of Lílá’s husband and others, were but the motionless
imageries of her own imagination.</p>

<p class='c009'>38. Whoever views the false apparitions of the dead as
present before the vision of his mind, he must know them
as reflections of his past and constant remembrance of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>39. So our notions of all these worlds are mere products
of our reminiscence, and no creation of Brahmá or any other
cause; but simple productions of our desire (which presents
these figures to the imagination).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>40. So they who are ignorant of the knowable spirit of
God, have only the notions of the outer world in them; as
they view the distant orb of the moon within themselves (in
their minds).</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. The lot of living beings and the cause of
their death. The duration of human life as determined by their
acts and enjoyments, and the merit of their conduct in life time.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> goddess continued:—Those therefore who know the
knowable God, and rely in virtue, can go to the spiritual
worlds and not others. (Knowable means what ought to be and
not what is or can be known).
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. All material bodies which are but false and erroneous
conceptions of the mind, can have no place in Truth (the
true spirit); as no shadow can have any room in sunshine.
(So gross matter has no room in the subtile spirit).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Lílá being ignorant of the knowable (God), and unacquainted
with the highest virtue (the practice of Yoga), could go
no further than the city of her lord which she had at heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. The waking Lílá said:—Let her be where she is (I inquire
no more about her); but will ask you of other things. You
see here my husband is about to die, so tell me what must
I do at present.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Tell me the law of the being and not being of beings, and
what is that destiny which destines the living beings to death.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. What is it that determined the natures of things and
gave existence to the categories of objects? What is it that
has caused the warmth of the fire and sun, and gave stability
to the earth?</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Why is coldness confined to the frost and the like, and
what forms the essence of time and space; what are the causes
of the different states of things and their various changes,
and the causes of the solidity of some and tenuity of others?</p>

<p class='c009'>8. What is that which causes the tallness of trees and men
above the grass and brambles; and why is it that many things
dwindle and decay in the course and capability of growth?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>9. The goddess said:—At the universal dissolution of the world,
when all things are dissolved in the formless void; there
remains the only essence of Brahma, in the form of the infinite
sky stretching beyond the limits of creation on all sides.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. It then reflects in its intellect in the form of a spark
of fire, as you are conscious of your aerial journey in a dream.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. This atomic spark then increased in its size in the divine
spirit, and having no substance of itself, appeared what is
commonly styled the ideal world.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. The spirit of God residing in it, thought itself as Brahmá—the
soul of the world, who reigned over it in his form of the mind,
as if it was identic with the real world itself. (The world
is a display of the Divine Mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>13. The primary laws that he has appointed to all things at
their first creation, the same continue invariably in force with
them to the present time. (<i>i.e.</i> The primordial law or nature).</p>

<p class='c009'>14. The minds of all turn in the same way as it was willed
by the divine mind, and there is nothing which of itself can
go beyond the law which the divine will has assigned to it.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. It is improper to say that all formal existences are
nothing, because they remain in their substance (of the divine
spirit), after disappearance of their forms; as the substance
of gold remains the same after alteration of its shape and
form.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. The elementary bodies of fire and frost still continue
in the same state, as their elements were first formed in
the Divine mind in the beginning of creation.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. Nothing therefore has the power to forsake its own
nature, as long as the divine intellect continues to direct
his eternal laws and decrees which are appointed to all.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. It is impossible for any thing to alter its nature now
from the eternal stamp, which Divine will has set upon all
the substantial and ideal forms of creation.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. As the Divine Intellect knows no opposition in its way, it
never turns from the tenor of its own wonted intelligence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>which directs the destinies of all. (This is the real or
subjective, intellectual or nominal view of evolution of
all things from the divine mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>20. But know in the first place the world to be no created
thing. All this that appears to exist, is but a display of
the notions in our consciousness, like the appearances in
our dreams.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. The unreal appears as real, as the shadow seems to be the
substance. Our notions of things are the properties of our
nature. (<i>i.e.</i> They are natural to us, as they are engrafted
in it by the eternal mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. The manner in which the intellect exhibited itself, in
its different manifestations, at the beginning, the same continues
in its course to this time, and is known as the <i>samvid-kachana</i> or
manifestations of consciousness, which constitute the <i>niyati</i>—course
or system of the universe.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. The sky is the manifestation of the intellectual idea
of vacuity in the divine mind; and the idea of duration in
the intellect, appeared in the form of the parts of time.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. The idea of liquidity evolved itself in the form of water
in the divine mind; in the same manner as one dreams of water
and seas in his own mind. (So the air and earth are manifestations
of the ideas of fluidity and solidity).</p>

<p class='c009'>25. We are conscious of our dreams in some particular state
of our intellect, and it is the wonderfully cunning nature
of the intellect, that makes us think the unreal as real.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. The ideas of the reality of earth, air, fire and water are
all false; and the intellect perceives them within itself, as
its false dreams and desires and reveries.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. Now hear me tell you about death, for removing your
doubts with regard to the future state; that death is destined
for our good, in as much as it leads us to the enjoyment of the
fruits of acts in this life.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. Our lives are destined in the beginning to extend to one,
two, three and four centuries in the different Kali, Dwápara,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Tretá and Satya ages of the world. (Corresponding with the
golden, silver, brazen and iron ages of the ancients).</p>

<p class='c009'>29. It is however by virtue of place and time, of climate
and food, and our good or bad actions and habits, that human
life extends above or descends below these limits.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. Falling short of one’s duties lessens his life, as his
excelling in them lengthens its duration; but the mediocrity
of his conduct keeps it within its proper bound.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. Boys die by acts causing infant diseases and untimely
deaths; so do the young and old die of acts that bring on
juvenile and senile weakness, sickness and ultimate death.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. He who goes on doing his duties as prescribed by law
of the Sástras, becomes both prosperous and partaker of
the long life allotted by the rule of the Sástra.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. So likewise do men meet their last state and future reward,
according to the nature of their acts in life-time; or else
their old age is subjected to regret and remorse, and all
kinds of bodily and mental maladies and anxieties.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. Lílá said:—Tell me in short, O moon-faced goddess!
something more with regard to death; as to whether it is a
pleasure or pain to die, and what becomes of us after we are
dead and gone from here. (Death is said to be release from
misery by some, and the most grievous of all torments by
others. So Pope:—O, the pain, the bliss of dying).</p>

<p class='c009'>35. The goddess replied:—Dying men are of three kinds, and
have different ends upon their death. These are those who
are ignorant, and such as are practiced in <i>yoga</i>, and
those that are reasonable and religious.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. Those practicing the <i>dháraná yoga</i>, may go wherever they
like after leaving their bodies, and so the reasonable <i>yogi</i>
is at liberty to range everywhere. (It consists in mental
retention and bodily patience and endurance).</p>

<p class='c009'>37. He who has not practiced the <i>dháraná yoga</i>, nor applied
himself to reasoning, nor has certain hopes of the future, is
called the ignorant sot, and meets with the pain and pangs of
death.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>38. He whose mind is unsubdued, and full of desires and
temporal cares and anxieties, becomes as distressed as a lotus
torn from its stalk. (<i>i.e.</i> It is the subjection of inordinary
passions, and suppression of inordinate desires and cares, which
ensure our true felicity).</p>

<p class='c009'>39. The mind that is not guided by the precepts of the Sástras,
nor purified by holiness; but is addicted to the society
of the wicked, is subjected to the burning sensation of fire
within itself at the moment of death.</p>

<p class='c009'>40. At the moment when the last gurgling of the throat chokes
the breath, the eye-sight is dimmed and the countenance fades
away; then the rational soul also becomes hazy in its intellect.</p>

<p class='c009'>41. A deep darkness spreads over the dimming sight, and
the stars twinkle before it in day-light; the firmament appears
to be obscured by clouds, and the sky presents its gloomy aspect
on every side.</p>

<p class='c009'>42. An acute pain seizes the whole frame, and a <i>fata Morgana</i>
dances before the vision; the earth is turned to air and the
mid-air seems to be the moving place of the dying person.</p>

<p class='c009'>43. The sphere of heaven revolves before him, and the tide
of the sea seems to bear him away. He is now lifted up
in the air, and now hurled down as in his state of dizziness
or dream.</p>

<p class='c009'>44. Now he thinks as falling in a dark pit, and then as
lying in the cavern of a hill; he wants to tell aloud his
torments, but his speech fails him to give utterance to his
thoughts.</p>

<p class='c009'>45. He now finds himself as falling down from the sky, and now
as whirled in the air like a bundle of straws blown aloft in
the air by a gust of wind. He is now riding swiftly as in a car,
and now finds himself melting as snow.</p>

<p class='c009'>46. He desires to acquaint his friends of the evils of life
and this world; but he is carried away from them as rapidly as
by an air-engine, (like a stone shot by a ballista or an aeronaut
in a balloon).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>47. He whirls about as by a rotatory machine or turning
wheel, and is dragged along like a beast by its halter. He
wallows about as in an eddy, or turns around as the machine
of some engine.</p>

<p class='c009'>48. He is borne in the air as a straw, and is carried about as
a cloud by the winds. He rises high like a vapour, and then
falls down like a heavy watery cloud pouring out in the sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>49. He passes through the endless space and revolves in all its
vortiginous vacuities, to find as it were, a place free from
the vicissitudes to which the earth and ocean are subject. (<i>i.e.</i>
A place of peace and rest).</p>

<p class='c009'>50. Thus the rising and falling spirit roves without cessation,
and the soul breathing hard and sighing without intermission,
sets the whole body in sore pain and agony.</p>

<p class='c009'>51. By degrees the objects of his senses become as faint to his
failing organs, as the landscape fades to view at the setting of
the sun. (The world recedes; it disappears: Pope).</p>

<p class='c009'>52. He loses the remembrance of the past and present, upon the
failing of his memory at this moment; as one is at a loss to
know the sides of the compass after the evening twilight has
passed away.</p>

<p class='c009'>53. In his fit of fainting, his mind loses its power of thinking;
and he is lost in a state of ignorance, at the loss of all his
thoughts and sensibility. (So the lines:—It absorbs me quite,
steals my senses, shuts my sight. Pope).</p>

<p class='c009'>54. In the state of faintishness, the vital breath ceases to
circulate through the body; and at the utter stoppage of its
circulation, there ensues a collapse <i>murch’ha</i> or swooning.</p>

<p class='c009'>55. When this state of apoplexy joined with delirium, has
reached its climax, the body becomes as stiff as stone by the
law of inertia, ordained for living beings from the beginning.</p>

<p class='c009'>56. Lílá said:—But tell me, O goddess, why do these pains and
agonies, this fainting and delirium, and disease and insensibility,
overtake the body, when it is possessed of all its eight
organs entire?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>57. The goddess replied:—It is the law appointed by the author
of life from the first, that such and such pains are to fall
to the lot of living beings at such and such times. (Man’s
primeval sin brought pain and disease and death into the world).</p>

<p class='c009'>58. The primeval sin springs of itself as a plant in the conscious
heart of man, and subjects him to his doomed miseries, which
have no other intelligible cause. (There is no other assignable
cause of death and disease except the original guilt).</p>

<p class='c009'>59. When the disease and its pain overpower the body, and
prevent the lungs and arteries to expand and contract, in order
to inhale and exhale the air, it loses its equipoise (samána)
and becomes restless.</p>

<p class='c009'>60. When the inhaled air does not come out, nor the exhaled
breath re-enter the lungs, all pulsation is at a stop; and the
organic sensations are lost in their remembrance only. (As in
the memory of sleeping and dreaming men).</p>

<p class='c009'>61. When there is no ingress nor egress of the vital air, the
pulse sinks and becomes motionless, and the body is said to
become senseless, and the life to be extinct.</p>

<p class='c009'>62. I shall also die away in my destined time, but my consciousness
of former knowledge will all be awake at the hour of death (which
proves the immortality of the soul).</p>

<p class='c009'>63. Though I am dead and gone from here in this manner,
yet I must mind, that the seed of my innate consciousness
(the soul), is never destroyed with my life and body.</p>

<p class='c009'>64. Consciousness is inward knowledge and imperishable in its
nature; therefore the nature of consciousness is free from
birth and death. (The body is subject to birth and death, but
not the soul).</p>

<p class='c009'>65. This consciousness is as clear as a fresh fountain in some
persons, and as foul as tide water in others; it is bright in its
form of the pure intellect—<i>chit</i> in some, and polluted with the
passions of animal life, in its nature of the sentient or living
soul—<i>chetana</i> in many.</p>

<p class='c009'>66. As a blade of grass is composed of joints in the midst,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>so is the even nature of the sentient or living soul; which is
combined with the two states of birth and death amidst it.</p>

<p class='c009'>67. The sentient soul is neither born nor dead at any time;
but witnesses these two states as the passing shadows and
apparitions in a dream and vision.</p>

<p class='c009'>68. The soul is no other than the intellect, which is never
destroyed anywhere by any. Say, what other thing is this soul,
which is called the <i>Purusha</i> beside the intellect itself.
Gloss. It is not the body, nor the vital breath, nor perceptions
nor mind; it is not the understanding nor egoism, nor the heart
nor illusion, all of which are inactive of themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>69. Say then whom and what you call to be dead today, and
whether the intellect is liable to disease or demise at any
time and in any wise. Millions of living bodies are verily
dying every day, but the intellect ever remains imperishable.</p>

<p class='c009'>70. The intellect never dies at the death of any living being;
because all the living soul continues the same upon the demise
of every body here.</p>

<p class='c009'>71. The living soul therefore, is no more than the principle
which is conscious of its various desires, affections and passions.
It is not that principle to which the phases of life and death
are attributed by men.</p>

<p class='c009'>72. So there is none that dies, nor any one that is born at any
time; it is this living principle only that continually revolves
in the deep eddy of its desires.</p>

<p class='c009'>73. Considering the unreality of the visible phenomena, there
can be no desire for them in any body; but the inward soul that
is led by its egoism to believe them as true, is subject to death
at the dis-appearance of the phenomena.</p>

<p class='c009'>74. The recluse ascetic flying from the fears of the world as
foreign to his soul; and having none of its false desires rising
in his breast, becomes liberated in his life and assimilated with
the true ONE.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LV.<br> <br><span class="smcap">The states of Life and Death.</span><br></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">L</span>ílá</span> said:—Tell me, goddess! for edification of my knowledge,
the manner in which a living being comes to die and
to be re-born in another form.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. The goddess replied:—As the action of the heart ceases to
act, and the lungs blow and breathe no more, the current of the
vital airs is utterly stopped, and the living being loses its
sensibility.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. But the intellectual soul which has no rise nor fall,
remains ever the same as it abides in all moving and unmoving
bodies, and in air, water, fire and vacuum. Gloss. So saith
the Sruti:—The soul is unlimited, permanent and imperishable.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. When the hindrance of breathing, stops the pulsation, and
motion of the body, it is said to be dead; and is then called
an inert corpse (but not so the soul).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. The body being a dead carcase, and the breathing mixing with
the air, the soul is freed from the bonds of its desires, and
flies to and remains in the mode of the discrete and self-existent
soul. Gloss. The Sruti says:—“His elemental parts
mix with the elements, and his soul with the Supreme.” The
unconditioned—<i>nirupadhika</i> spirit, joins with the Holy spirit;
but not so the conditioned (upádhika) soul of the unholy.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. The soul having its desires and styled the animal spirit—Jíva,
is otherwise than the <i>átman</i>—soul. It remains in its sepulchral
vault under the same atmosphere as the soul of Padma, which
thou sawst hovering about his tomb. Gloss. The desire binds
down the spirit to its own sphere. (The Ghost hovering about
the charnel vault. Milton).</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Hence such departed spirits are called <i>pretas</i> or ghosts of
the dead, which have their desires and earthly propensities
attached to them; as the fragrance of the flower is concentrated
in its pollen, and thence diffused through the air.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>8. As the animal souls are removed to other spheres, after
their departure from this visible world, they view the very
many scenes and sights; that their desires present before them
like visions in a dream.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. The soul continues to remember all its past adventures,
even in its next state, and finds itself in a new body, soon after
the insensibility of death is over. Gloss. This is the <i>linga</i> or
<i>súkshma deha</i>—the spiritual or subtile body of spiritualism.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. What appears an empty vacuum to others, seems as a
dusky cloud to the departed soul, enveloping the earth, sky,
moon and all other orbs within its bosom (the circumambient
atmosphere).</p>

<p class='c009'>11. The departed spirits are classed in six orders, as you
shall now hear from me; namely, the great, greater and greatest
sinners, and so likewise the three degrees of the virtuous.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. These are again subdivided into three kinds, as some
belonging to one state, and others composed of two or three states;
(<i>i.e.</i> of virtue and vice intermixed) in the same individual soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. Some of the most sinful souls, lose the remembrance
of their past states for the period of a whole year; and remain
quite insensible within themselves, like blocks of wood or stone.
(This is called the <i>pretárasthá</i> continuing for a whole year after
death). (It is allied to Abraham’s bosom or Irack of Mahomedans).</p>

<p class='c009'>14. Rising after this time, they are doomed to suffer the
endless torments of hell; which the hardness of their earthly
mindedness has brought upon them. (This is the Purgatory of
Christians).</p>

<p class='c009'>15. They then pass into hundreds of births, leading from
misery to misery, or have a moment’s respite from the pains in
their short lived prosperity, amidst their dreaming journey
through life. (These transmigrations of the soul, are the
consequences of its evil propensities).</p>

<p class='c009'>16. There are others, that after their torpor of death is over,
come to suffer the unutterable torments of torpidity, in the
state of unmoving trees (which are fixed to undergo all the
inclemencies of weather).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>17. And others again that having undergone the torments of hell,
according to their inordinate desires in life, are brought to
be re-born on earth, in a variety of births in different forms.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. Those of lesser crimes, are made to feel the inertness of
stones for sometime, after the insensibility attending upon
their death. (This means either the insensibility of dead bodies,
or that of mineral substances.)</p>

<p class='c009'>19. These being awakened to sensibility after some period,
either of duration long or short (according to their desert);
are made to return on earth, to feel the evils of brutish and
beastly lives.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. But the souls of the least sinful, come to assume soon
after their death, some perfect human form, in order to enjoy
the fruits of their desire and desert on earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. These desires appear before the soul as dreams, and
awaken its reminiscence of the past, as present at that moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>22. Again the best and most virtuous souls, come soon after
their death, to find themselves in heavenly abodes, by reason
of their continued thoughts and speculations of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. Some amongst them, are brought to enjoy the rewards of
their actions in other spheres, from which they are sent back
to the mortal world, at the residences of the auspicious and
best part of mankind.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. Those of moderate virtues are blown away by the atmospheric
air, upon the tops of trees and medicinal plants, where they
rove about as the protozoa, after the insensibility of death
is over.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. Being nourished here by the juice of fruits, they descend
in the form of serum and enter into the hearts of men, whence
they fall into the uterus in the form of <i>semen virilis</i>, which
is the cause of the body and life of other living beings.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gloss says:—Having enjoyed in the next world the good
fruits of their virtuous deeds, they are blown down on earth by
the winds and rain. Here they enter in the form of sap and
marrow in the vegetable productions of corn, grain and fruits; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>these entering the body of animals in the form of food, produce
the semen, which becomes the cause of the lives and bodies of all
living beings.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. Thus the dead, figure to themselves some one of these states
of living bodies, according to their respective proclivity,
after they recover from the collapse attending upon their death.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. Having thought themselves to be extinct at first, they
come to feel their resuscitation afterwards, upon receiving the
offering of the mess, made to their departed spirits (by their
surviving heirs).</p>

<p class='c009'>28. Then they fancy they see the messengers of death, with
nooses in their hands, come to fetch them to the realm of <i>Yama</i>;
where they depart with them, (with their provision for one year
offered in their Srádh ceremony).</p>

<p class='c009'>29. There the righteous are carried in heavenly cars to the
gardens of Paradise, which they gain by their meritorious acts
in life.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. But the sinful soul, meets with icebergs and pitfals,
tangled with thorns and iron pikes, and bushes and brambles
in its passage, as the punishment of its sins.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. Those of the middling class, have a clear and paved
passage, with soft grassy path-ways shaded by cooling arbours,
and supplied with spring waters on both sides of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. On its arrival there, the soul reflects within itself that:
“here am I, and yonder is <i>Yama</i>—the lord of the dead. The other
is the judge of our actions—Chitragupta, and this is his
judgment given on my behalf”.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. In this manner the great world also, appears to every one
as in a dream; and so the nature and manner of all things,
present themselves before every soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. But all these appearances are as void as air; the soul
alone is the sentient principle, and the spacious space and
time, and the modes and motions of things, though they appear
as real, are nothing in reality.</p>

<p class='c009'>35. Here (in <i>Yama’s</i> court), the soul is pronounced to reap
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>the reward of its acts, whereby it ascends either to the blissful
heaven above, or descends to the painful hell below.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. After having enjoyed the bliss of heaven, or suffered the
torment of hell, it is doomed to wander in this earth again, to
reap the reward of its acts in repeated transmigrations.</p>

<p class='c009'>37. The soul springs up as a paddy plant, and brings forth
the grains of intelligence; and then being assembled by the
senses, it becomes an animal, and lastly an intelligent being.</p>

<p class='c009'>_i.e._ The insensible vegetable, entering into the animal body
in the form of food, is converted to a sensible but irrational
soul; but entering as food in the body of man, it turns to a
rational and human soul. The one Universal soul is thus diversified
in different beings. (It is the plant and food that sustains
and nourishes all souls. Gloss).</p>

<p class='c009'>38. The soul contains in itself the germs of all its senses,
which lie dormant in it for want of its bodily organs. It is
contained in the semen virilis of man, which passing into the
uterus, produces the fœtus in the womb of the female.</p>

<p class='c009'>39. The fœtus then becomes either well-formed or deformed,
according to the good or evil deeds of the person in its past
state; and brings forth the infant of a goodly or ill shapen
appearance.</p>

<p class='c009'>40. It then perceives the moonlike beauty of youthful bloom, and
its amorous disposition coming upon itself; and feels afterwards
the effects of hoary old age, defacing its lotus-like face, as
the sleets of snow, shatter and shrivel the lotus leaflets.</p>

<p class='c009'>41. At last it undergoes the pains of disease and death, and
feels the same insensibility of Euthanasia as before, and finds
again as in a dream its taking of a new form.</p>

<p class='c009'>42. It again believes itself to be carried to the region of
Pluto, and subjected to the former kinds of revolution; and thus
it continues to conceive its transmigration, in endless births and
various forms.</p>

<p class='c009'>43. Thus the aerial spirit goes on thinking, for ever in its
own etherial sphere, all its ceaseless metempsychosis, until
its final liberation from this changeful state.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>44. Lílá said:—Tell me kindly, O good goddess! for the
enlightenment of my understanding, how this misconception of
its changeableness, first came upon the soul in the beginning.</p>

<p class='c009'>45. The goddess replied:—It is the gross view of the abstract,
that causes us to assume the discrete spirit, in the concrete
forms of the earth and sky and rocks and trees (all of which
subsist in the spirit, and are unsubstantial in themselves).</p>

<p class='c009'>46. As the divine intellect manifests itself, as the soul and
model of all forms; so we see these manifestations, in the
transcendental sphere of its pure intelligence.</p>

<p class='c009'>47. In the beginning, God conceived himself as the lord of
creation (Brahmá); and then as it were in a dream, he saw in
himself, all the forms as they continue to this time.</p>

<p class='c009'>48. These forms were manifested in the divine spirit, at first
as his will; and then exhibited in the phenomenal world, as
reflexions of the same, in all their present forms.</p>

<p class='c009'>49. Among these some are called living beings, which have
the motions of their bodies and limbs; and live by means of the
air which they breathe, and which circulate in their bodies
through the lungs and arteries.</p>

<p class='c009'>50. Such also is the state of the vegetable creation from the first,
that they having their inward sensitiveness, are notwithstanding
devoid of outward motion, and receive their sustenance
by the roots; wherefore they are called <i>Pádapas</i> or pedobibers.</p>

<p class='c009'>51. The hollow sphere of the divine intellect, beaming with
intelligence, sends forth its particles of percipience, which form
the consciousness of some beings, and sensitiveness in others.</p>

<p class='c009'>52. But man uses his eyes to view the outer and the
reflected world (in disregard of his consciousness of the real);
although the eyes do not form his living soul, nor did they
exist at his creation and before his birth. (When his view was
concentrated within himself as in his sleeping visions).</p>

<p class='c009'>53. It is according to one’s estimation of himself, that he has
his proper and peculiar desires, and the particular form of his
body also. Such is the case of the elementary bodies likewise,
from their inward conception of their peculiar natures.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Gloss:—So the ideas of vacuity, fluidity and solidity forming
the bodies of air, water and earth; and the form of every thing
agreeing with its inherent nature.</p>

<p class='c009'>54. Thus all moving and unmoving things, have their movable
and immovable bodies, according to their intrinsic disposition
or idiosyncrasy as such and such.</p>

<p class='c009'>55. Hence all self-moving beings have their movable bodies,
conforming with the conception of their natures as so and so;
and in this state of their belief, they continue to this time,
with their same inborn or congenital bodies.</p>

<p class='c009'>56. The vegetable world still continues in the same state of
fixedness, from its sense of immobility; and so the rocks and
minerals continue in their inert state, from the inborn sense
of their inertness.</p>

<p class='c009'>57. There is no distinction whatever between inertness and
intelligence, nor any difference betwixt production, continuance
and extinction of things; all which occur in one common essence
of the supreme.</p>

<p class='c009'>58. The varying idiocrasy subsisting in vegetables and minerals,
makes them feel themselves as such, and causes their various
natures and forms, as they have to this time.</p>

<p class='c009'>59. The inward constitution of all immovable objects, makes
them remain in their stationary states; and so of all other
substances, according to their different names and natures.</p>

<p class='c009'>60. Thus the inward crasis or quality of worms and insects,
makes them conceive themselves according to their different
kinds, and gives them their particular natures for ever.</p>

<p class='c009'>61. So the people under the north pole know nothing about
those in the south, except that they have the knowledge of
themselves only (as ever subject to the intense cold of the
frigid zone).</p>

<p class='c009'>62. So also all kinds of moving and unmoving beings, are
prepossessed with their own notions of things, and regard all
others according to the peculiar nature of themselves. (Átmá
vat &amp;c.).</p>

<p class='c009'>63. Again as the inhabitants of caves, know nothing of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>outsiders; and as the frogs of dirty pools are unacquainted with
pure water of streams; so is one sort of being ignorant of the
nature of another.</p>

<p class='c009'>64. But the inane intellect, residing in the form of the all pervasive
mind, and all sustaining air; knows the natures of all things in
all places.</p>

<p class='c009'>65. The vital air that enters all bodies through the pores of
their bodies, is the moving principle, that gives life and motion
to all living beings.</p>

<p class='c009'>66. Verily the mind is situated in all things, whether they
are moving or immovable; and so is the air, which causes the
motion in some, and quiescence in others.</p>

<p class='c009'>67. Thus are all things but rays of the conscious soul, in this
world of illusion, and continue in the same state as they have
been from the beginning.</p>

<p class='c009'>68. I have told you all about the nature of things in the
world, and how un-realities come to appear as real unto us.</p>

<p class='c009'>69. Lo here this king Vidúratha is about to breathe his last,
and the garlands of flowers heaped on the corpse of thy husband
Padma, are now being hung upon the breast of Vidúratha.</p>

<p class='c009'>70. Lílá said:—Tell me goddess! by what way he entered
the tomb of Padma, and how we may also go there to see what
he has been doing in that place.</p>

<p class='c009'>71. The goddess said:—Man goes to all places by the way of
his desires, and thinks also he goes to the distant future,
in the spiritual form of pure intellect.</p>

<p class='c009'>72. We shall go by the same way (aerial or spiritual), as you
will like to take; because the bond of our friendship will make
no difference in our choice and desires.</p>

<p class='c009'>73. Vasishtha said:—The princess Lílá being relieved of her pain,
by the recital of this agreeable narration; and her intellectual
sight being brightened, by the blazing sun of spiritual light;
beheld the insensible and unmoving Vidúratha, breathe out his
last expiring breath.</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. The desire of the king, and his departure to the realm
of death, followed by Lílá and the goddess; and their arrival
to his former city.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> continued:—In the meantime the eye-balls of the king
became convoluted, and his lips and cheeks grew pale and dry,
with his whole countenance; and there remained only the slender
breath of life in him.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. His body became as lean as a dry leaf, and his face turned
as ghastly as the figure of death; his throat gurgled as the
hoarsest beetles, and his lungs breathed with a bated breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. His sight was darkened upon the insensibility of death,
and his hopes were buried in the pit of despair; and the sensations
of his external organs, were hid within the cavity of his heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. His figure was as senseless as a picture in painting, and
all his limbs were as motionless, as those of a statue carved
upon a block of marble.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. What need is there of a lengthy description, when it may
be said in short; that his life quitted his body, as a bird
flies off afar from a falling tree.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. The two ladies with their divine eye-sight, beheld his
animal spirit, flying upwards in the sky in its aerial form; and
his consciousness disappearing, like the odour of a flower wafted
by the wind.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. His living soul being joined with its spiritual body, began
to fly higher and higher in the air; as it was led by its inward
desire or expectation of ascending to heaven.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. The two ladies kept going after that conscious soul, like
a couple of female bees, pursuing a particle of perfume borne
afar in the air on the wings of the wind.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. Then in a moment after the fainting fit of death was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>over; the conscious soul was roused from its insensibility,
like some fragrance expanding itself with the breeze.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. It saw the porters of death, carrying away the souls of
the dead, that have resumed their grosser forms, by means of
the mess offerings of their kinsmen to their manes.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. After a long year’s journey on the way, it reached at the
distant abode of <i>Yama</i>, with the hope of reaping the reward
of its acts; but found the gate fast beset by beasts of prey. (Like
the Cerberus at the hellgate of Pluto).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. Yama, on beholding the departed spirit of every body
brought before him, ordered to find out its foul acts all
along its life time.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. On finding the prince’s spirit spotless, and ever inclined
to virtuous acts and to have been nourished by the grace of
the goddess of wisdom:—</p>

<p class='c009'>14. He ordered it to be released, and re-entered into its former
dead body, which lay buried under the flowers in the tomb.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. It was then let to fly in the etherial path, with the
swiftness of a stone flung from a sling; and was followed
by the living Lílá and the goddess in the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. The living soul of the king thus sailing through the sky,
did not observe the forms of the two ladies that followed it,
though they saw it all along its course. (Because heavenly
forms are invisible to mortal eyes and souls).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. They traversed through many worlds, and soon passed the
bounds of the extra-mundane systems; till they arrived at the
solar world, whence they descended on this orb of the earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. The two self-willed forms (of Lílá and the goddess), in
company with the living soul of the king; arrived at the royal
city of Padma, and entered the apartment of Lílá.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. They entered in a trice and of their own free will, into the
inside of the palace; as the air passes in flowers, and the sunbeams
penetrate in the water, and the odors mix with the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. Ráma asked:—How was it Sir, that they entered into
the abode adjoining to the tomb, and how could they find out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>the way to it, the one having been dead a long time, and all
three being but bodiless vacuity?</p>

<p class='c009'>21. Vasishtha replied:—The tomb of the dead body of the prince,
being impressed in his soul, and the object of its desire,
led his spirit insensibly to it, as if it were by its inborn
instinct.</p>

<p class='c009'>22. Who does not know, that the endless desires which are
sown in the human breast, like the countless seeds of a fig fruit,
come of their own nature, to grow up to big trees in their time?</p>

<p class='c009'>23. Just as the living body bears its seed—the subtile or <i>linga
deha</i> in the heart, which germinates and grows to a tree at last;
so every particle of the intellect, bears the mundane seed in itself.
(The cosmos is contained in every individual soul).</p>

<p class='c009'>24. As a man placed in one country, sees within himself
his house, which is situated in a far distant land, so the soul
sees the objects of his distant desires, ever present before it.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. The living soul, ever longs after the best object of its
desire; though it may undergo a hundred births, and become
subject to the errors and delusions of his senses, and of this
illusive world. (For whatever is born in the root, must come
out in the seed; and that which is bred in the bones, must appear
in the flesh).</p>

<p class='c009'>26. Ráma rejoined:—There are many persons, that are free
from their desire of receiving the funeral cake: now tell me, sir,
what becomes of those souls, who get no cake offering at their
Srádh.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. Vasishtha replied:—The man having the desire of receiving
the mess settled in his heart, and thinking it to be offered to
him; is surely benefitted by its offering. (The funeral cake like
every other food, is said to nourish the spirit, and cause its
resuscitation in a new life and body).</p>

<p class='c009'>28. Whatever is in the heart and mind, the same notions
form the nature of living beings; and whether these are in their
corporeal or incorporeal states, they think themselves as such
beings and no other. (The sense of personal identity accompanies
the soul everywhere).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>29. The thought of having received the <i>pinda</i> cake, makes a
man <i>sapinda</i>, though it is not actually offered to him; so on
the other hand the thought of not being served with the cake,
makes a <i>sapinda</i> become a <i>nispinda</i> (or one served with it
becomes as one without it).</p>

<p class='c009'>30. It is verily the desire of all living beings to be such and
such as they have in their hearts, and that is the cause of their
becoming so in reality. (Gloss. The ordinance of the necessity of
cake offering, fosters its desire in the hearts of men. Or, which
is the same thing, the desire of receiving the funeral cake, is
fostered in the hearts of men, by the ordinance of Srádh).</p>

<p class='c009'>31. It is the thought of a man, that makes the poison savour
as nectar to his taste; and it is his very thought that makes an
untruth seem as truth to him. (Gloss. The thought of a
snake-catcher that he is the snake eating Garuda, makes him
swallow the bitter poison as sweet honey; and the thought of
snake-bite from the pricking of a thorn, mortifies a man by his
false fear or imagination only).</p>

<p class='c009'>32. Know this for certain, that no thought ever rises in any
one without some cause or other; hence the desire or thought
which is inherent in the spirit, is the sole cause of its
regeneration on earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. Nobody has ever seen or heard of any event, occurring
without its proper cause; except the being of the Supreme Being,
which is the causeless cause of all beings, from their state of
not-being into being.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. The desire is inherent in the intellect, like a dream in
the soul; and the same appears in the form of acts, as the Will
of God is manifested in his works of creation.</p>

<p class='c009'>35. Ráma said:—How can the spirit that is conscious of its
demerit, foster any desire of its future good; and how can
it profit by the pious works of others for its salvation?
(as the Srádh made by the relatives of the deceased).</p>

<p class='c009'>36. Tell me too whether the pious acts of others, which are
offered to the manes go for nothing; and whether the absence
of future prospects of the unmeritorious ghost, or the benevolent
wishes of others (for its future good) are to take effect.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>37. Vasishtha said:—A desire is naturally raised in one at
its proper time and place, and by application of appropriate acts
and means; and the rising of the desire necessarily overcomes
its absence. Gloss. So a Srádh done in proper season and
manner, serves to the benefit of the desertless spirit.</p>

<p class='c009'>38. The pious gifts made on behalf of the departed souls,
accrue to them as their own acts; and the sense which they thus
acquire of their worthiness, fills them with better hopes and
desires of their future state. (Hence rises the hope of redemption
by means of the redeeming son of man).</p>

<p class='c009'>39. And as the stronger man gains the better of his adversary,
so the later acts of piety drive away the former impiety
from the spirit. Therefore the constant practice of pious acts
is strictly enjoined in the Sástras.</p>

<p class='c009'>40. Ráma said:—If the desire is raised at its proper time
and place, how then could it rise in the beginning when there
was no time nor place: (<i>i.e.</i>, when all was void and yet Brahma
had his desire and will).</p>

<p class='c009'>41. You say that there are accessory causes, which give rise
to the desires, but how could the will rise at first without any
accessory cause whatever?</p>

<p class='c009'>42. Vasishtha replied:—It is true, O long-armed Ráma,
that there was neither time nor place in the beginning,
when the Spirit of God was without its will.</p>

<p class='c009'>43. And there being no accessory cause, there was not even
the idea of the visible world, nor was it created or brought
into existence; and it is so even now.</p>

<p class='c009'>44. The phenomenal world has no existence, and all that is
visible, is the manifestation of the Divine Intellect, which
is ever lasting and imperishable.</p>

<p class='c009'>45. This will I explain to you afterwards in a hundred
different ways, and it is my main purpose to do so; but hear me
now tell you what appertains to the matter under consideration.</p>

<p class='c009'>46. They having got in that house, saw its inside beautifully
decorated with chaplets of flowers as fresh as those of the
spring season.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>47. The inmates of the palace were quietly employed in their
duties, and the corpse of the king was placed upon a bed of
<i>mandara</i> and <i>kunda</i> flowers.</p>

<p class='c009'>48. The sheet over the dead body, was also strewn over with
wreaths of the same flowers; and there were the auspicious
pots of water placed by the bed side.</p>

<p class='c009'>49. The doors of the room were closed, and the windows were
shut fast with their latchets; the lamps cast a dim light on
the white washed walls around, and the corpse was lying as a
man in sleep, with the suppressed breathing of his mouth and
nostrils.</p>

<p class='c009'>50. There was the full bright moon, shining with her delightsome
lustre, and the beauty of the palace, put to blush the paradise
of Indra; it was as charming as the pericarp of the lotus of
Brahmá’s birthplace, and it was as silent as dumbness or a dummy
itself, and as beautiful as the fair moon in her fulness.</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. Unsubstantiality <i>of the aerial</i> body
of Lílá and the Spiritual bodies of Yogis.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> continued:—They beheld there the younger
Lílá of Vidúratha, who had arrived there after her demise,
and before the death of that king.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. She was in her former habit and mode with the same body,
and the same tone and tenor of her mind; she was also as
beautiful in all her features, as in her former graceful
form and figure when living.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. She was the same in every part of her body, and wore the
same apparel as before. She had the very ornaments on her
person, with the difference that it was sitting quietly in
the same place, and not moving about as before.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. She kept flapping her pretty fan (chouri), over the corpse
of the king; and was gracing the ground below, like the rising
moon brightening the skies above.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. She sat quiet, reclining her moonlike face on the palm of
her left hand; and decorated with shining gems, she appeared
as a bed of flowers, with new-blown blossoms on it.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. With the glances of her beautiful eyes, she shed showers
of flowers on all sides; and the brightness of her person,
beamed with the beams of the etherial moon.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. She seemed to have approached to the lord of men, like
the goddess Lakshmí, appearing before the god Vishnu; and
with the heaps of flowers before her, she seemed as Flora
or the vernal season in person.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Her eyes were fixed on the countenance of her husband, as
if she was pondering his future well-being; and there was a
melancholy like that of the waning moon, spread over her face,
to think of his present woeful state.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>9. They beheld the damsel, who however had no sight of
them; because their trust was in truth, and saw everything
clearly; while her views being otherwise, she could not
discern their spiritual forms.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. Ráma said:—You have said Sir, that the former Lílá
had repaired there in her reverie and spiritual form,
by the favour of the goddess of wisdom.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. How do you now describe her as having a body, which
I want to know how and whence it came to her.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. Vasishtha replied:—What is this body of Lílá, Ráma! It
is no more true than a false imagination of her gross spirit,
like that of water in the mirage. (It is the conception of one’s
self as so and so, that impresses him with that belief also).</p>

<p class='c009'>13. It is the spirit alone that fills the world, and all bodies
are creations of the fancy. This spirit is the Intellect of God,
and full of felicity in itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. The same understanding which Lílá had of herself to
her end, accompanied her to her future state; and the same
notion of her body followed her there, though it was reduced
to dust, as the ice is dissolved into water.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. The spiritual bodies also, are sometimes liable to fall into
error, and think themselves as corporeal bodies, as we mistake
a rope for the serpent.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. The belief in the materiality of any body, as composed of
the earth and other elements, is as false as it is to believe
the hares to have horns on their heads.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. Whoso thinks himself to have become a stag in his
dream, has no need of seeking another stag for comparing
himself with it. (<i>i.e.</i> Men are actuated by their own
opinion of themselves).</p>

<p class='c009'>18. An untruth appears as truth at one time, and disappears
at another; as the error of a snake in a rope, vanishes upon
the knowledge of its falsehood.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. So the knowledge of the reality of all things, in the
minds of the un-enlightened; is dispersed upon conviction
of their un-reality in the minds of the enlightened.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>20. But the ignorant, that have a belief in the reality of this
world of dreams, believe also in the transmigration of the animal
soul, like the revolution of the globe on its own axis.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. Ráma asked:—If the bodies of Yogis be of a spiritual
nature, how is it that they are seen to walk about in the
sights of men?</p>

<p class='c009'>22. Vasishtha replied:—The Yogi may take upon himself various
forms, without the destruction of his former body; as the
human soul may deem itself transformed to a stag or any other
being in a dream, without undergoing any change in its spiritual
essence. (The identity of the self is not lost under any
form of the body. Locke).</p>

<p class='c009'>23. His spiritual body is invisible to all, though it may
appear as visible to their sight. It is like the particles
of frost seen in sun-beams, and as the appearance of a white
spot in autumnal sky (when there is no frost nor cloud in it).</p>

<p class='c009'>24. No body can easily discern the features of a Yogi’s body, nor
are they discernible by other Yogis. They are as imperceptible
as the features of a bird flying in the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. It is from the error of judgment, that men think some
Yogis to be dead and others to be living; but their spiritual
bodies are never subject to death or common sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. The embodied soul is subject to errors, from which the
souls of Yogis are free; because their knowledge of truth has
purged the mistake of a snake in the rope, from their souls.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. What is this body and whence it is, and what of its
existence or destruction? What is lasting remains forever and
is freed from the ignorance it had before (and it is the soul
which is ever lasting and free from error).</p>

<p class='c009'>28. Ráma said:—Whether the embodied soul takes the spiritual
form, or is it something other than this. Tell me this and
remove my doubt.</p>

<p class='c009'>29. Vasishtha said:—I have told this repeatedly to you, my
good Ráma! and how is it that you do not understand it yet,
that there exists only the spiritual body, and the material
form is nothing?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>30. It is by habit of constant meditation, that you must know
your spiritual state, and subdue your sense of corporeality; and
as you abstain from the latter, so you attain to the former state.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. Then there will be an end of your sense of the gravity and
solidity of objects, like the disappearance of the visions of a
dreaming man, when he comes to wake.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. The body of a Yogi becomes as light and subtile, as the
evanescent appearances in a dream: (the fleeting objects of
vision).</p>

<p class='c009'>33. And as a dreaming man feels the lightness of his body, in
his dreaming rambles; so the Yogi finds his solid body, as
volatile as air in all places.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. The expectation of the longlife of a master-head in his
material body, is realized in the spiritual one, after the corpse
has been burnt away. (Longevity consists in the longlife of the
spirit and not of the body).</p>

<p class='c009'>35. Every body must have to assume his spiritual frame
afterwards; but the Yogi finds it in his life-time, by the
enlightenment of his intellect.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. As a man upon his waking from sleep, remembers his having
an intellectual form in his dreaming state; so the Yogi
is conscious of his spiritual body in his own intellect.</p>

<p class='c009'>37. The notion of the corporeal body is a mere fallacy, like that
of the snake in a rope; hence nothing is lost by the loss of this
body, nor is anything gained by its production and regeneration.</p>

<p class='c009'>38. Ráma said:—Now tell me Sir, what the inmates of the
house thought this Lílá to be; whether they viewed her as an
embodied being or a bodiless apparition appearing before them.</p>

<p class='c009'>39. Vasishtha answered:—They took the sorrowful queen to
be some friend of the king, and to have come from some place
they knew not what and where.</p>

<p class='c009'>40. They did not like to examine the matter, because it is
the nature of the ignorant like that of brutes, to believe what
they see, without investigation or consideration of its nature.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>41. As a stone flung at random flies off from its mark, so the
brutish and ignorant folks go astray, from hitting at the true
mark of a thing placed before them.</p>

<p class='c009'>42. As we know not what becomes of the objects of our dream,
and whither they are fled upon our waking; such is the case
with our material bodies, which are as false and fleeting as
our delusive dreams.</p>

<p class='c009'>43. Ráma said:—Tell me Sir, where the hill we dream of, is
hid upon our waking; kindly remove my doubt, as the wind
disperses the autumnal clouds.</p>

<p class='c009'>44. Vasishtha said:—All things appearing in our dream or residing
in our desire as the hill, &amp;c., are absorbed in our consciousness
whence they sprang; just as the motion of bodies subsides in the
air which gives the vibration.</p>

<p class='c009'>45. As the motion of the air mixes with the fixed ether,
so the dreams and desires which we are conscious of, set
in the unchanging soul whence they have their rise.</p>

<p class='c009'>46. Our dreams like our knowledge of all other things, are
made known to us by our consciousness, the nature of which is
unknown to us as that of the inward soul. (Consciousness and
the soul are represented as two different predicaments, and the
one is not predicated of the other, as we say—the conscious
soul).</p>

<p class='c009'>47. We do not find our dreams and desires as distinct from
our consciousness of them; they appertain to it in the same
manner, as fluidity to water and motion to the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>48. Whatever difference may appear to exist between them,
is the effect of sheer ignorance; and this gross ignorance
is the feature of this world, known as the phantom of fancy.</p>

<p class='c009'>49. As it is impossible to conceive two co-eternal and co-existent
causes together (as an efficient and a material cause); so it
is wrong to suppose the dream as a distinct existence or otherwise,
than an act of our consciousness.</p>

<p class='c009'>50. There is no difference whatever between the dreaming
and waking states; in dream we see a false city appearing to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>view, so in waking you behold the unreal world, standing as a
reality before you.</p>

<p class='c009'>51. Nothing can be truly existent that appears as true in a
dream; this being always true of the visions in a dream, it is
likewise so of the external phenomena, appearing to the sight in
our day dreams.</p>

<p class='c009'>52. As the hill in a dream, immediately disappears into airy
nothing, so the material world sooner or later disappears into
naught by thinking on its nihility.</p>

<p class='c009'>53. A Yogi is seen by some to mount in the air, and by
others as a dead body lying on the ground; and this is according
to one’s belief in his spiritual or material body, that every
one sees him in his own way.</p>

<p class='c009'>54. The view of the phenomenal world as distinct from the
Unity, is as false as a sight in delusion or magical show; or a
dream or delirium of the great Illusion—<i>máyá</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>55. Others who are blinded by similar errors, entertain as
in a dream, the notion of their reproduction after being awakened
from the insensibility of their death like sleep; but the spiritual
body of the Yogi shines and soars upward, after passing
over the mirage of the false appearances of the world.</p>

Argument. Extinction of the Spiritual life
of Lílá, and Restoration of Padma’s Life.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> continued:—It was in the meantime that the
goddess of wisdom, stopped the course of Vidúratha’s
life, as we stop the flight of our minds at will.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Lílá said:—Tell me, goddess, what length of time has
expired, since the corpse of the king was laid in this
tomb, and I was absorbed in my deep meditation.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. The goddess replied:—A month has passed since these
maid servants of thine have been waiting here for watching
thy body, which they thought lay asleep in the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Hear excellent lady! what has become of thy body, after
it was rotten in a fortnight and evaporated in the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Seeing thy lifeless corpse lying as cold as frost on the
ground, and turning as dry as a log of wood, or rather as a
withered leaf on the floor;—</p>

<p class='c009'>6. The royal ministers thought thee to be dead of thyself
(a suicide), and removed thy putrid carcase out of the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. And what more shall I say, than they laid thy corpse on
a heap of sandal wood, and having set fire to the pile with the
sprinkling of ghee, they reduced it to ashes in a short while.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Then the family raised a loud cry that their queen was
dead, and wept bitterly for sometime, after which they
performed thy funeral ceremonies.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. Now when they will behold thee coming here in thy same
body, they must be astonished to think thee as returned
from the next world of the dead.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. Now my daughter, when thou shalt appear before them
in this thy purer and spiritual form, they must look upon
thee with astonishment.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>11. For thou hast not thy former form at present, but it is
changed to a purer one, agreeably to the tenor and temperament
of thy mind. (Lit. according to the desire in thy heart).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. For every body beholds every thing without him, according
to his inward feelings; as for example the sight of shadowy
ghosts is frequent to children, that have a fear of devils at
heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. Now, O beauteous lady! Thou art an adept in spiritualism,
and hast a spiritual body on thee, and hast forgotten and
forsaken thy former body, with all the desires connate with it.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. The view of material bodies, is lost to the sight of spiritualists;
and the intelligent view them in the light of autumnal
clouds, which are void of substance. (<i>i.e.</i> The flimsy clouds
which are without rain-water in them).</p>

<p class='c009'>15. On attainment of the spiritual state, the material body
becomes as an empty cloud, and as a flower without its odor.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. When a man of pure desire, is conscious of his attaining
the spiritual state; he loses the remembrance of his material
body, as a youth forgets his embryonic state.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. It is now the thirty first day that we have arrived at
this place; and I have caused the maid servants here, to
fall into a fast sleep this morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. Now Lílá! let us advance before the wilful Lílá, and
then discover to her at our will, the form of the truthful
Lílá, and her manner and conduct to thee.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. Vasishtha said:—So saying, they wished themselves to be
perceived by the wilful Lílá, and stood manifest to her sight
in their etherial forms of the goddess and her inspired dame.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. At this instant the Lílá of Vidúratha, looked upon them
with her staring eyes; and found the room lighted up by the
full lustre of their bodies.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. The apartment seemed to be lighted by the bright orb of the
moon, and its wall washed over with liquid gold; the ground floor
shone as paved with ice, and all was full of splendour.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>22. After seeing the brightness of the bed chamber, Lílá
looked up at the goddess and the other Lílá, and rising
respectfully before them, she fell at their feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. Be victorious, O ye goddesses! she said, that have blessed
me with your visit, and know that know all, that I have come
here first as a preparer of your way. (Lit. as the sweeper of
your path).</p>

<p class='c009'>24. As she was speaking in this manner, they received her
with good grace, and then all the three sat together on a
bedding in their youthful bloom, like luxuriant creepers
on the snow capt top of Meru.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. The goddess said:—Tell us daughter, how you came
here before ourselves, how you have been, and what you
have seen on your way hither.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. The younger Lílá answered:—As I lay insensible on
that spot (upon the shock of my death), I was enveloped in
darkness like the new moon, and felt myself burnt away by
the flame of a conflagration (<i>i.e.</i>, funeral fire).</p>

<p class='c009'>27. I had no sense nor thought of anything good or bad,
but remained with my eyes closed under my eye-lids.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. Then I found myself, O great goddess! after I had
recovered from my anaesthesia of death, to assume (by
mistake a new body agreeably to my former impression),
and to be translated at once into the midst of the sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>29. I mounted on the vehicle of winds, and was borne like
fragrance to this mansion through the etherial space.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. I found this house guarded by its warders, and lighted
with lamps, and having a costly bedstead placed in the midst
of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. I am looking here upon this corpse, as my husband
Vidúratha, who has been sleeping here with his body covered
under the flowers, like the vernal god in a flower garden.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. I thought he was taking his rest, after the fatigue of the
warfare, and did not like to disturb his repose in this place.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. I have now related to you, my gracious goddesses! all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>that I have seen and thought of, since I have been restored to
my new life.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. The goddess spake:—Now I tell thee Lílá, that hast such
beautiful eyes, and movest like a swan, that I will raise the
corpse of the king to life from his bed in this bier.</p>

<p class='c009'>35. Saying so, she breathed the breath of life as the lotus
lets off its fragrance; and it fled into the nostrils of the
carcase, like a creeping plant crawls into a hole.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. It entered into the heart through the vital sheath, as the
wind penetrates into the hole of a bamboo; and the breath of
life was fraught with desires, as the waves of the sea sparkle
with pearls.</p>

<p class='c009'>37. The infusion of life, added to the colour of the face and
body of king Padma; as the rain-water refreshes the fading lotus
in a drought.</p>

<p class='c009'>38. By degrees the members of the body became renovated,
like a garden with its returning flowering season; and as the
sides of a hill become virescent, with fresh grown bushes and
creepers.</p>

<p class='c009'>39. The person of the king shone as the queen of the stars,
with all her digits of the full moon, when she enlightens the
whole world, with the beams of her radiant face.</p>

<p class='c009'>40. All his limbs became as tender and roscid, as the branches
of trees in spring; and they regained their bright and golden hue,
like the flowers of the vernal season.</p>

<p class='c009'>41. He oped his eyes which were as clear as the sky, with their
two pupils rolling as the two orbs of light; and enlightening
the world, with their charming and auspicious beams.</p>

<p class='c009'>42. He raised his body, as the Vindhyá mountain uplifts its head,
and cried, “who waits there” with a grave and hoarse voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>43. The two Lílás responded to him saying:—“your commands;”
when he beheld the two Lílás in attendance upon him,
and lowly bending themselves at his feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>44. Both of them were of the same form and features, and
of the like demeanour and deportment towards him. They were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>alike to one another in their voice and action, as in their
joy and gladness at his rising.</p>

<p class='c009'>45. Then looking upon them he asked, “what art thou and who
is she”? At this the elder Lílá responded to him saying—“deign
to hear what I have to say”.</p>

<p class='c009'>46. I am Lílá thy former consort, and was joined as twain
in one with thee, as sounds and their senses are combined
together.</p>

<p class='c009'>47. The other Lílá is but a reflexion of myself, and cast by
my free will for your service.</p>

<p class='c009'>48. The lady sitting here beside the bed, is the goddess of
wisdom—the blessed Sarasvatí, and mother of the three worlds;
set her on the golden seat before you.</p>

<p class='c009'>49. It is by virtue of our great merit, that she has presented
herself to our sight, and brought us back from other worlds to
your presence in this place.</p>

<p class='c009'>50. Hearing this, the lotus-eyed king, rose from his seat,
and with pendant wreaths of flowers and a strap of cloth
hung about his neck, prostrated himself at her feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>51. He exclaimed:—I hail thee, O divine Sarasvatí! that dost
confer all blessings on mankind. Deign to confer on me the
blessings of understanding and riches with a long life.</p>

<p class='c009'>52. As he was saying so, the goddess touched him with her
hand and said, “be thou my son, possessed of thy desired
blessings, and gain thy blessed abode in future.</p>

<p class='c009'>53. “Let all evils and evil thoughts be far from thee, and all
thy discomforts be dispersed from this place; let an everlasting
joy alight in thine hearts, and a thick population fill thy happy
realm. May all prosperity attend on thee for ever.”</p>

Government of the kingdom and his final Liberation.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> said:—“Be it so,” said Sarasvatí and disappeared
in the air; and the people rose in the morning with
their revivified king.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. He embraced the renascent Lílá, who embraced him in her
turn, and they were exceeding glad in their coming to life again.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. The palace was filled with loud acclamations of joy as those
of giddy revelry: and the citizens were full of mirth and merry,
song and music.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. The shouts of victory, and sounds of huzzas and heydays,
resounded in the air, and the people elated with joy, thronged
at the royal courtyard to see their king.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. The genii of the Siddhas and Vidyádharas, dropped down
handfuls of flowers from above; and the sound of drums and
kettles, and trumpets and conches, resounded on all sides.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. The elephants roared aloud on the outside, with their
uplifted trunks; and crowds of females filled the inner
court-yard, with their loud rejoicings.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Men bearing presents to the king, fell upon one another at
their mutual clashing; and others wearing the flowery chaplets
on their heads and hairs, moved gracefully all about.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. The red turbans of joy on the heads of the chiefs and
host of citizens, and the waving of the reddish palms of
dancing girls, filled the sky with a bed of red lotuses.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. The ground also was strewn over with rosy flowers, by
foot-falls of dancers with their reddish soles; and the pendant
earrings of ballet girls, which flourished with the oscillation
of their heads and shoulders, waved in the air like flowers of
gold.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>10. The silken veils which like autumnal clouds, covered the
faces of fairy damsels in their dancing, glittered as so many
moons shining in the court-yard.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. The people then retired to their respective abodes, with
loud applause of the queen’s return with her husband from the
other world.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. The king Padma heard of his adventures from the hearsay
of his subjects, and made his purificatory ablution, with
the waters of the four seas of the earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. Then the royal ministers and ministerial Bráhmans,
joined together in the act of his installation, like the
synod of immortals, meeting at the inauguration of Indra.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. The two Lílás continued in company with the king,
to relate with delight their respective adventures,
and the wisdom they had gathered thereby.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. It was thus by grace of the genius of wisdom and their
own experience, that this king Padma and his two queens,
obtained their prosperity equal to that of the three worlds.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. The king, who was fraught with the wisdom imparted to
him by the goddess; continued to rule over his kingdom for
thousands of years, in company with his consorts.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. They reigned on earth, in their state of living liberation
for myriads of years; and then receiving the perfect knowledge
of the holy Siddhas, they became wholly liberated after their
deaths.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. The happy pair having reigned jointly, over their delightful
realm of ever increasing population, and which was graced
by learned men and righteous people, knowing their own rights
and duties of doing good to all mankind, became freed from
the burden of their state affairs for ever.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LX.<br> <br><span class="smcap">On Duration and Time and Thoughts of the Mind.</span><br></h2>
</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. The reason of introducing the two Lílás in the tale.
The one as the counterpart of the other.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> said:—I have related to you this tale, prince!
for removing your error of the phenomenal world. Mind
this tale of Lílá, and renounce your misconception of
the gross material world.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. The substantiality of phenomena is a <i>nil</i> by itself, and
requires no pains to invalidate it. It is hard to disprove a reality;
but there is no difficulty in effacing a falsehood from the mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. True knowledge consists in viewing the visibles as void,
and knowing the one vacuum as the sole unity and real entity;
one loses himself at last in this infinite vacuity. (Vasishtha
was a <i>súnya vádi</i> or vacuist, which Sankaráchárya was at
the pains to refute in his Dig-vijaya).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. When the self-born Brahmá created the world from nothing,
and without the aid of any material or elementary body; it is
plain that there was an eternal void, and all these are but
manifestations of the vacuous soul. (The <i>Teom</i> and <i>Beom</i> of
Genesis, corresponding with <i>Tama</i> and <i>Vyom</i> of the Veda, were the
origin of creation).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. The same creative soul, has spread the seeds of its consciousness
in the stream of creation, and these produce the images as they
incessantly appear to us, unless we take the pains to repress them.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. The appearance of the world, is but a perspective of the
sphere of divine intellect; and contained in the small space of
human intellect within the soul; as in a transparent particle
of sand.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Such being the case, say what is the essence of this
erroneous conception, and what may be our desires of reliance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>in it, and what can be the meaning either of destiny or necessity?
(The predestination and chance, to which the Fatalists ascribe
the origination of the universe).</p>

<p class='c009'>8. This entire whole which is visible to the eye, is but a
false appearance as that of magic; and there is no truth nor
substance in a magic show.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. Ráma said:—Oh! the wondrous exposition of the world,
that you have now explained to me. It refreshes my soul,
as the moon-beams revive the blades of grass, that have
been burnt down by a conflagration.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. It is after so long, that I have come to know the truly
knowable; such as what and how it is, and the manner whereby,
whence and when it is to be known.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. I have my peace and rest in pondering on this wonderful
theory, and your elucidation of the doctrines of the Sruti
Sástras.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. But tell me this one thing to remove my doubt, as my
ears are never satiate, with drinking the nectarious juice
of your sweet speech.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. Tell me the time, which transpired during the three
births of Lílá’s husband. Was it the duration of a day and
night in one case, and of a month in another, and the period
of a whole year in the case of Vidúratha?</p>

<p class='c009'>14. Or did any one of them live for many years, and whether they
were of short or longer durations, according to the measure
of men, gods or Brahmá. (Because a human year is a day and
night of the polar gods, and a moment of the cycle of Brahmá.
And revolution of the whole planetary system to the same point
makes a day of Brahmá).</p>

<p class='c009'>15. Please sir, kindly tell me this, because little hearing
is not sufficient to me, as a drop of water is not enough to
moisten the dry soil or the parched ground of summer heat.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. Vasishtha said:—Know sinless Ráma! that whosoever
thinks of anything in any manner at any place or time, he
comes to feel the same in the same manner, and in the same
place and time.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>17. Take for instance the destructive poison, which becomes as
ambrosia to venomous insects, that take it for their dainty
nourishment; and so is an enemy turning to a friend by your
friendly behaviour unto him. (In both cases the evil turns
to good by our taking it as such).</p>

<p class='c009'>18. And the manner in which all beings consider themselves,
and all others for a length of time; the same they seem to be
by their mode and habit of thinking, as if it were by an act of
destiny. (<i>i.e.</i> They consider their thoughts of things as their
destined nature, which is not so in reality; for fair is foul and
foul is fair; according as our judgments declare).</p>

<p class='c009'>19. The manner in which the active intellect represents a
thing in the soul, the same is imprinted in the consciousness
of its own nature. (Here the <i>Chit</i> is said to be the
<i>intellectus agens</i> and consciousness—<i>Samvid</i>—the
<i>intellectus patiens</i>. The motion of the mind gives us the
impressions of the swiftness and slowness of time).</p>

<p class='c009'>20. When our consciousness represents a twinkling of the eye
as a <i>Kalpa</i>, we are led to believe a single moment an age
of long duration. (As a short nap appears an age in dreaming),
and (a long age as a moment as in the case of the seven sleepers
of Kehef).</p>

<p class='c009'>21. And when we are conscious of or think a <i>Kalpa</i> age as
a twinkling, the <i>Kalpa</i> age is thought to pass as a moment;
and so a long night in our unconscious sleep, appears as a
moment upon waking.</p>

<p class='c009'>22. The night appears a longsome age, to the long suffering
sick, while it seems as a moment, in the nightly revels of the
merry; so a moment appears as an age in the dream, and an
age passes off as a moment in the state of insensibility. (The
length and shortness of duration, depending on our consciousness
and insensibility of the succession of our ideas. (See Locke and
Kant on our idea of time)).</p>

<p class='c009'>23. The notions of the resurrection of the dead, and of one’s
metempsychosis, and being re-born in a new body; of his being
a boy, youth or old man; and of his migrations to different places
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>at the distance of hundreds of leagues, are all but the
phenomena of sleep, and retrospective views in a dream.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. King Haris Chandra is said, to have thought a single
night as a dozen of years; and the prince Lavana to have passed
his long life of a hundred years as the space of a single night.
(So the seven sleepers of <i>Kehef</i> passed a long period as
one night, and so of others).<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>25. What was a moment to Brahmá, was the whole age of
the life-time of Manu (Noah); and what is a day to Vishnu,
constitutes the long period of the life-time of Brahmá. (This
alluded to the comparative differences in the cycles of planetary
bodies presided by the different deities; such as Jupiter’s cycle
of 60 years round the sun, is but one year to the presiding god
of that planet).</p>

<p class='c009'>26. The whole life-time of Vishnu, is but one day of the
sedate Siva; for one whose mind is motionless in his fixed
meditation, is unconscious of the change of days and nights
and of seasons and years. (Since the meditative mind is
insensible of the fluctuation of its ideas, or that there
is an utter quietus of them in the quietism of the Yogi’s mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>27. There is no substance nor the substantive world, in the
mind of the meditative Yogi (who views them in their abstract
light); and to whom the sweet pleasures of the world, appear as
bitter, as they are thought to be the bane of his true felicity.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. The bitter seems to be sweet, by being thought to be so;
and what is unfavorable, becomes favorable as that which is
friendly comes to be unfriendly by being taken in their contrary
senses. (The mind can make a heaven of hell and a hell of a
heaven. Milton).</p>

<p class='c009'>29. Thus Ráma! it is by habitual meditation, that we gain the
abstract knowledge of things; as on the other hand we forget
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>what we learnt, by want of their recapitulation. (Habit is
second nature, and practice is the parent of productions).</p>

<p class='c009'>30. These by their habitude of thinking, find every thing
in a state of positive rest; while the unthinking fall into the
errors of the revolutionary world, as a boat-passenger thinks the
land and objects on the shore, to be receding from and revolving
around him.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. Thus the unthinking part of mankind, and those wandering
in their error, think the world to be moving about them; but
the thinking mind, sees the whole as an empty void, and full
of phantoms, as one sees in his dream.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. It is the thought (erroneous conception), that shows the
white as black and blue; and it is the mistake of judgment,
that makes one rejoice or sorrow at the events of life.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. The unthinking are led to imagine a house where there
is none; and the ignorant are infatuated to the belief of
ghosts, as they are the killers of their lives.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. It is reminiscence or memory, which raises the dream as
her consort; and which represents things as they are presented
to it, by the thoughts of the waking state.</p>

<p class='c009'>35. The dream is as unreal as the empty vacuity, abiding in the
hollow receptacle of the intellectual soul; it overspreads
the mind like the shadow of a cloud, and fills it with images
like those of a puppet-show under the magic lantern.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. Know the phenomena of the revolving worlds, to be no
more in reality, than mere resultants of the vibrations of the
mind, in the empty space of the soul; and as the motions and
gestures of the fancied hobgoblins, to the sight of children.</p>

<p class='c009'>37. All this is but a magical illusion, without any substance
or basis of itself; and all these imposing scenes of vision,
are but the empty and aerial sights of dreams.</p>

<p class='c009'>38. Just as the waking man, beholds the wondrous world
before him, so also does sleeping man see the same; and both of
them resemble the insensible pillar, which finds the images of
statues engraved upon it (because the soul is ever awake in
every state of all living bodies).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>39. The great monument of the Divine Spirit, has the figure
of the created world, carved in itself in the same manner,
as I see a troop of soldiers passing before me in my dream.
(All these appear to be in action, in their true state of
nullity and inaction).</p>

<p class='c009'>40. So is this waking world asleep in the soul of Brahma,
and rises in his mind as the vegetable world springs from
the sap lying hid in the earth, which gives it its growth
and vernal bloom.</p>

<p class='c009'>41. So likewise does the creation lie hid in, and spring from the
Supreme Spirit; as the brightness of gold ornaments is contained
in, and comes out of the material metal. (The Divine Spirit
is both the material and efficient cause of creation—<i>ex quo &amp; a
quo</i>.)</p>

<p class='c009'>42. Every atom of creation, is settled in the plenum of
Divine spirit; as all the members of the body, are set in the
person of their possessor.</p>

<p class='c009'>43. The visible world has the same relation, to the bodiless
and undivided spirit of God; as one fighting in a dream bears
to his antagonist (both believing in their reality, while both
of them are unreal in their bodies).</p>

<p class='c009'>44. Thus the real and unreal, the spirit and the world, all
dwindled into vacuum, at the great <i>Kalpánta</i> annihilation of
creation, except the intellect of God which comprises the world
in itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>45. The causality of the one (<i>i.e.</i> the spirit of God), and the
unreality of the world cannot be true (since nothing unreal <a id="can"></a>can
come out of the real). Except Brahm—the all (<i>to pan</i>), there is
no other cause, as a Brahmá or any other; the Divine Intelligence
is the only cause and constituent of its productions.</p>

<p class='c009'>46. Ráma asked:—But what cause was it that represented the
citizens, counsellors and ministers of Vidúratha’s royal house
also to Lílá’s vision, in the same manner as her lord the king,
(who was alone the object of her thought)?</p>

<p class='c009'>47. Vasishtha said:—All other thoughts are associated with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>the principal one in the intellect, in the same manner as
the high winds are accompaniments of the storm.</p>

<p class='c009'>48. The association of thoughts, follows one another in a long
and perpetual train; and caused the succession of the sights
of the ministers, citizens and subjects of the king, in Lílá’s
vision one after the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>49. In this way the thought that the king was born of
such and such a family, naturally introduced the thoughts
of his palace and city, and of those that dwelt in them.</p>

<p class='c009'>50. It is in vain to enquire into the cause and manner, of
the intellect’s being combined with its thoughts at all times;
since it is called the gem of thoughts (Chintámani), and must
be always accompanied with its radiating thoughts, like a
brilliant gem with its rays. (<i>i.e.</i> Thinking is the inseparable
attribute of the mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>51. Padma thought to become a king like Vidúratha, in the
proper discharge of the duties of his royal family; and this
constant thought of himself as such, cast the mould of the
mind and manner of Vidúratha upon him (<i>i.e.</i> he looked himself
in the light of that king).</p>

<p class='c009'>52. All animate beings of every kind, are but models of
their own thoughts, like looking-glasses showing their
inward reflexions to the sight. (The innate man appearing
in his outward figure, is a verity in physiognomy).</p>

<p class='c009'>53. The mind which is fixed in the meditation of God, and
remains unshaken amidst the turmoils of the world; is fraught
with perfect rest, and preserves the composure of the soul,
until its final liberation from the bondage of the body.</p>

<p class='c009'>54. But the thoughts of the fluctuating enjoyments of this
world, alternately represented in the mirror of the mind,
like the shadows of passing scenes upon a looking glass.</p>

<p class='c009'>55. It requires therefore a great force of the mind, to overcome
its worldly thoughts, and turn them to the channel of truth; as
the greater force of the main current of a river, leads its
tributaries to the ocean.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>56. But the mind is greatly disturbed, when the worldly and
spiritual thoughts, press it with equal force to both ways;
and it is then, that the greater force leads it onward in
either way. (There is no midway like that of the <i>Mádhyamikas</i>
between this world and the next).</p>

<p class='c009'>Gloss. The worldly and spiritual thoughts being equally
forcible, they naturally struggle in the mind, and that
which is of greater force overcomes the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>57. Such is the case with all the myriads of beings, whether
are living, dead or to come to life; and the same accidents take
place in the particles of all human minds (like the concussions
of atomic forces).</p>

<p class='c009'>58. All this is the empty sphere of the Intellect, all quiet
and without any basis or substratum. It is neither peopled
nor filled by any thing except its own native thoughts.</p>

<p class='c009'>59. All these appear as dreams, even in our unsleeping states, and
have no form or figure in the sight of the wise. The perception
of their positive existence, is but a misconception of their
negative inexistence.</p>

<p class='c009'>60. There really exists but one omnipotent and all pervasive
Spirit, which shows itself in diverse forms like the flowers,
fruits and leaves of trees, all appearing from the self-same
woody trunk (which like the great Brahma is the origin of all
its off-shoots.)</p>

<p class='c009'>61. He who knows the increate Brahma to be the measurer,
measure and the thing measured, (<i>i.e.</i> the creator, created
and the creation), to be all one and himself, can never
forget this certain truth of unity, nor ever fall into the
error of dualism of the cause and effect.</p>

<p class='c009'>62. There is but one Being (SAT), who is Holy and without
beginning; and who, though he appears to be of the forms of
light and darkness, and of space and time, doth never rise
nor set anywhere. He is without beginning, middle or end;
and remains as a vast expanse of water, exhibiting itself
in its waves and currents.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>63. The notion of myself, thyself and the objective world,
are but effusions of our perverted understandings; and it is
ignorance only that shows the One as many within the Sheath
of the mind, according as it imagines it to be.</p>

</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Vasishtha said:—Because we have the knowledge of all
things (<i>i.e.</i> the objective), to be contained alike in our
consciousness (as of the subjective self); it is plain that this
eternal and increate self (or soul), is the cause and container
of them all at all times.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. That which has an insight or intuitive knowledge of all
things, which are expressed by words and their meanings, is
Brahma—the soul and no other; and nothing that is meant by
any significant term, has a different form of its own. (It
is the doctrine of nominalism that the notions conveyed by
words have no realities corresponding with them in the mind,
and have no existence but as mere names).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. As the quality of a bracelet is not different from its
substance of gold, nor that of a wave from the water; so the
expansion of the world, is not distinct from the spirit of
God. (The spirit inflated and produced the world out of itself.
Sruti).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. It is Brahma that is manifest in the form of the world, and
not the world that appears as God; and so doth gold display
itself in the form of a bracelet, and not the bracelet that
takes the nature of gold.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. As the whole is displayed in all its various parts, so the
entire intellect shows itself in all the various operations of
the mind composing the world. (The intellect displaying the
mind, and this the world).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>7. It is ignorance of the infinite and eternal Spirit of God, that
exhibits itself as myself, thyself and the world itself in the
mind. (<i>i.e.</i> The knowledge both of the subjective and objective
results from ignorance of the only One—tanmátram).</p>

<p class='c009'>8. As the shades of different colours in gems, are not apart
from the gems; so the notions of one’s self and the world are
the shades inherent in the self-same intellect.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. Like waves appearing on the surface of the undulated
waters of the deep; this so-called and meaningless creation,
is but a <i>phasis</i> in the Divine Intellect.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. Neither does the Spirit of God reside in the creation, nor
does the creation subsist in the Divine Spirit (like waves in
the waters); nor is there such relation as of a part with the
whole between them. (These are <i>not</i> parts of one undivided
whole).</p>

<p class='c009'>11. One should meditate on his intellect as the form of the
Divine Intellect, in his own consciousness of it; and he will
feel the Divinity stirring within himself, as it were stirred
by the breath of a breeze. (There is a divinity stirring within
us, Addition).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. The minute particle of the vacuous intellect, will then
appear in its wondrous form of a void, within the empty space
of his conscious mind. (The primary hypostasis of the vacuous
soul being but a void, its attributes of the intellect and mind,
are of the same form).</p>

<p class='c009'>13. He then finds this vacuous form stirring in himself as
the airy spirit, with its property of feeling, as it is felt in
the <i>flatus venti</i> or breath of air. (This is the Spirit of God).</p>

<p class='c009'>14. The God then assumes a luminous form as the state of his
own substantiality; and this is posited in the sheath of the
intellect as a spark of fire. (This is the holy light of the
God of glory or glorious God).</p>

<p class='c009'>15. The light then melts into water as the self-same substance
of itself; and this fluid substance contains in it the property
of taste. (This is the liquid state of the floating spirit before
creation).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>16. The same is condensed in the form of a solid substance,
which is the same with the Divine Mind. This becomes the
earth bearing in its bosom the property of smell. (The earth
being produced from the scum of water, is dissolved again into
its watery form).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. Again God represents himself to our intellect, as one
infinite and uniform duration; and its measures in twinklings
and other divisions, are but manifestations of the succession of
our thoughts. (Prakachanamvidah parampará—is the very doctrine
of Locke and others).</p>

<p class='c009'>18. The other states in which God presents himself to our
intellects are that, He is Holy, infinitely glorious, seen within
us,<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a> and without beginning, middle and end; that, He has no
rising nor setting, and subsists of Himself without a substratum
and as the substratum of all.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. This knowledge of God is bliss itself, and his creation
is identic with himself. Ignorance of God leads to the knowledge
of the objective world, and its extinction is the way to
know the eternity of His existence.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. Brahma is conceived in the same manner in our souls, as
He is represented to us by our intellects; just as we know
all other things according to our ideas of them, in our all comprehensive minds.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. Of these, those things only are true, the notions of which
we derive from the dictates of our well-directed understandings;
as all those are untrue, which the mind paints to us from the
impressions of the senses and the meanings of words; which are
incapable of expressing the nature of the undefinable and
indescribable God (whom no words can express—<i>Yato vácho
nivastante</i>. (Sruti))</p>

<p class='c009'>22. Know the unreal world which appears as real, and the
reality of God which appears as unreality, to be of the manner
of the air in motion and at rest. The visible world like the
current air, appears true to them, that have no knowledge of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>the invisible God, who is as calm as the still air underlying
the etherial air and its fluctuations.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. A thing may appear different from another, and yet be
the same with it; as the light in the fire is the selfsame fire.
So the visible world arising from the invisible Brahma, appears
as another reality; though it is same with the reality of
God.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. All things whether in being or not being, subsist in God as
their invisible and unknown source and cause; as the unscooped
earth is the cause of the would-be doll, the unhewn tree of
a future statue, and the soot of the ink not <i>in esse</i>. (So
all future statues are contained in the unhewn marbles, according
to Aristotle).</p>

<p class='c009'>25. One thing is exhibited as another in the great desert of
the Divine Mind, which shows the phenomena of the world as
figures in the mirage.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. The wise soul thinks this world as one with its source—the
Divine Intellect, as he considers the tree no way different
from its parent seed.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. As the sweetness of milk, the pungency of pepper, the
fluidity of water, and the motion of winds, are the inseparable
properties of their substances:—</p>

<p class='c009'>28. So this creation is inseparable from the spirit of Brahma,
and is a mere form of the one Supreme soul, beside which there
is nothing in reality. (Whose body nature is, and God the
soul).</p>

<p class='c009'>29. This world is the manifestation of the lustre of the gem
of Divine mind, and has no other cause except the essence of
Brahma, which is no other than its material cause—the Supreme
soul itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. The will, the mind, the living soul, and its consciousness,
are all the offspring of Divine intellection; because there is
nothing that can be produced by exertion of any power without
direction of the Intellect.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. There is nothing that rises or sets anywhere, nor appears
or disappears at any time; but everything is unborn at all times,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>and lies quiet in the Divine Intellect, which is as solid as a
massive rock.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. To attribute the formation of these multitudes of the
combination of atoms, and to suppose every particle to be
composed of minutest infinitesimals; are but vagaries of
imagination, as none of them could combine of themselves
except by direction of the eternal mind. (Matter having no
force nor design in itself).</p>

<p class='c009'>33. All force resides in some living principle, as the waking,
sleeping and dreaming states appertain to the living soul; and
as the undulation of waves subsists in the water; (or) as the
current of the stream lies hidden in it.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. When the living soul feels its inappetency towards worldly
enjoyments, it is then said to have reached to his highest
perfection by the Sruti (such as:—<i>nishkáma</i> or abandonment
of the desire of fruition, is the highest state of human
felicity).</p>

<p class='c009'>35. As the mind is freed from its choice and dislike of
things, so is the soul liberated by avoiding its egoism and
personality, and then it has no more to be conscious of the
pain, attending upon a future birth and transmigration.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. Whoso comes to know in his understanding, this state of
supreme and inexpressible felicity; he is sure to overcome
all his worldly appetites, that bind him fast to this earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>37. But whoso labours in his mind under his affections to this
world, he has to rove continually in it as in the whirlpool of
a stream, and destroys the supreme felicity of his soul in his
continuous turmoil.</p>

<p class='c009'>38. It was the lotus-born Brahmá, that was conscious of his
egoism at first, and who has by the will of his mind, spread
out this universe. (He is eternally acting, and has not
retired after his act of creation).</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXII.<br> <br><span class="smcap">Interpretation of Destiny.</span><br></h2>
</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. The erroneous conception of creation and of
Destiny both as active and inactive.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> continued:—These myriads of worlds and the
millenniums of <i>kalpa</i> ages, are no more real in themselves
than our false computation of the millionth part of an atom or
the twinkling of an eye.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. It is our error that represents them as true to us, though
they are as false as our calculation of those infinitesimals.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. These creations whether past or future, follow one another
in endless succession, like the overflowing currents of water,
with all the waves, eddies and whirlpools in them.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. The prospect of these created worlds is as false, as the
delusive mirage, which presents a stream of water, flowing
with strings of flowers, fallen from the plants on the shore.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. The conceptional creation is as baseless as a city in a dream
or magic show; or as mountain in fiction, or an imaginary castle
in air.</p>

<p class='c009'>(It is a <i>flatus venti</i>, and not based on any thing real; but has
a mere psychological existence, depending on fancy and imagination).</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Ráma said:—Sir, the drift of your reasoning, leads to the
establishment of the identity of the conceptional creation
with the creator; and that this unity of both is the belief
of the learned and wise. (So says Hegel: “creation is the
reality of God; it is God passing into activity” Lewe’s
Hist. Ph. II p. 626).</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Now tell me, what you have to say with regard to the
material bodies, which these existence bear on earth; and
what is the cause that the body is subject to the casualties
unknown to the inward spirits. (<i>i.e.</i> The body is subject
to material laws, but not so the immaterial spirit which
has no change).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>8. Vasishtha replied:—There is a supernatural and active
energy of the Divine Intellect, called the predominant Decree,
Fate or Destiny, which must come to pass, and bear its command
over all our actions and desires. (Destiny is irresistible, being
the decree of Providence, governing all events and our free wills
also. Fate is the personification of the female agency of god.
Here Vasishtha is a fatalist also; but his fate is the Divine
decree).</p>

<p class='c009'>9. She is invested from the beginning with irresistible and
multifarious powers; and destines the manner in which every
thing is to take place and continue for ever. (The philosophical
destiny is the sum of the laws of universe, of matter and mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>10. She is the essential cause of all essence, and the chief
mover of the intellect; she is styled as the great power of
powers, and remains as the great viewer of all things.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. She is called the great agency and the great producer of
all events; She is known as the chief mover of occurrences, and
she is the soul and source of all accidents. (The mythological
Destiny is superior to gods and men, and rules over the great
Jove himself).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. She whirls the worlds as straws, and bears her sway
over the deities and demons; she commands the Nága dragons
and the mountain monsters to the end of time.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. She is sometimes thought to be an attribute of Divine
essence, and to remain pictured in her ever varying colours in
the hollow vacuity of the Divine Mind. (The theological destiny
is the Almighty Will of God and his foreknowledge also; before
which the fates float about, as if they are drawn up in variegated
pictures).</p>

<p class='c009'>14. The learned have explained Brahmá the Demiurge, to be
identic with the Spirit of Brahma, for the understanding of
those that are ignorant in spiritual knowledge; and by destiny
they mean his creation. (<i>i.e.</i> Creation is destination of
the preordaining and irrevocable will of God).</p>

<p class='c009'>15. The immovable spirit of Brahmá, appears to be full of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>moving creatures and the infinity of Divine existence, seems to
teem with the finite creation in the midst of it, like a grove
of trees growing under the concavity of the hollow sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. The unwaking spirit of God reflected various images in itself
(as in a dream), likening to the reflection of a dense forest
in the lens of a crystal stone: and these were understood by the
demiurgus Brahmá, as the prototype of the destined creation,
in the hollow sphere of the Divine mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. The Intellect naturally exhibits a variety of forms in
itself, as the body of an embodied person, shows its various
members to view; and these were taken by the lotus-born Brahmá,
as the several parts in the great body of the cosmos. (The
Intellect is the phantasmagoria of the world, and the Demiurge
is the formal framer of it).</p>

<p class='c009'>18. This foreknowledge of events imprinted in the Intellect of
God, is called Destiny, which extends over all things at all
times. (This is <i>Fatum christianum</i>, that every thing is
regulated by foreknowledge and Providence).</p>

<p class='c009'>19. The meaning of Destiny, comprises the knowledge of the
causes, which move, support and sustain all things in their proper
order; and that such and such causes, must produce such and
such effects for ever. (This is the Stoic Fate of Jewish
Essences; or a concatenation of causes whence all things
necessarily result).</p>

<p class='c009'>20. This destiny is the force or mobile power, that moves all
men and animals, and vegetable and inanimate creations; it is
the beginning (or primary source) of the time and motion of
all beings. (It is <i>fatum</i> from <i>fari</i>—the word or decree
of Providence, that was the beginning of all existence.)</p>

<p class='c009'>21. It is combined with Divine power, as the power divine
is combined with it; and this combination of them into one,
is the cause of the production and existence of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>22. It is the union or conformity of human exertion, with
the course of destiny or decree of God, that is productive of
certain ends, which are respectively called their destiny and
destined effects. (Here Destiny is defined as the combination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>of human and superhuman powers; and that the co-operation
of natural and supernatural agencies, are necessary to the
production of effects).</p>

<p class='c009'>23. What more have you to ask me, Ráma! with regard to destiny
and self-exertion; when I tell you that it is destined to
all beings to betake themselves to their proper actions, in the
destined or prescribed manner, in order to bring about the desired
result? (Their destiny is equal to <i>Vidhi</i> or fixed laws, which
were combined in Brahmá).</p>

<p class='c009'>24. When a predestinarian sits idle and quiet, under the belief
of being fed by his fixed lot; he is then said to depend on his
destiny alone (as a fatalist).</p>

<p class='c009'>25. By sitting idle in the manner of a waiter on Providence, for
the whole of his lifetime, he gains nothing; but comes to lose
his good sense and energy in a short time, and finally dies away
in famine by his sole reliance on destiny. (Hence fate = fat and
faut (in Arabic), is synonymous with death).</p>

<p class='c009'>26. It is quite certain that whatever is destined, must surely
come to pass of its own accord; and that it is impossible to
prevent it by the foresight of gods and men.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. Yet the intelligent ought not cease to exert their activity,
by relying in their fates only; for they must know that it is our
exertion that brings destiny into action. (Because it is, destined,
that destiny requires to be enforced by human exertion, in order
to bring on its effect. It is operation which enforces the law,
which is otherwise dormant and a dead letter).</p>

<p class='c009'>28. Destiny is inactive and abortive, without an active power
to enforce it to action; it is human activity, that is productive
of any effect or production in nature by the help of destiny.</p>

<p class='c009'>29. Depend on destiny, and remain both deaf and dumb as a
doll; be inactive, and become dull and torpid as a block. Say,
what is the good of this vital breath, unless it has its vitality
and activity? (Destiny has destined man to exertion in order to
produce the destined end; and has so ordained all animated
nature, in order to be productive).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>30. It is good to sit quiet; by restraining even the vital
breath in Yoga meditation; whereby one can obtain his liberation:
otherwise the inactive man is not to be called a Yogi, but an
idler and a lazzarone.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. Both activity and inactivity are good for our liberation
from pain; but the high minded esteem that as better, which
saves them from the greater pain of regeneration, (<i>i.e.</i> the
hybernation of Yoga meditation).<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>32. This inactive destiny is a type of the latent Brahmá; and
who so leans to it by laying aside his busy course, is verily
installed in the supremely holy state of highest felicity (as in
<i>ecstasis</i> and hypnotism).</p>

<p class='c009'>33. The inert destiny resides every where in the manner of
Brahma—the latent soul in all bodies, and evolves itself in
various shapes, by means of activity in all its productions.</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. Expansion of the Divine Spirit,
and its apparent variations in Nature.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> continued:—The essence of Brahma is all in all, and
ever remains in every manner in every thing in all places.
It is omnipotence, omniform and the lord God of all.
</p>

<p class='c009'>(This is the <i>to pan</i> of Pantheism, that, God is All and All
is God; that God and nature are one substance, and all its various
modifications. (This is the doctrine of Vedánta, Plato and
Plotinus, and lately of Sufism and German philosophy)).</p>

<p class='c009'>2. This Essence is the Spirit or Soul, whose omnipotence
developes itself sometimes in the form of intellectual activity,
and sometimes in the tranquility of soul. Sometimes it shows
itself in the <i>momentum</i> of bodies, and at others in the force
of the passions and emotions of the soul. Sometimes as something
in the form of creation, and at another as nothing in the annihilation
of the world. (This is the <i>to on onton</i>—the All of all; the
eternal source of all existence; the Subjective as well as Objective
both together).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Whenever it realises itself any where in any form or state,
it is then viewed in the same manner at the same place and
time. (The spirit realises itself in one form or other of its
own free Will).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. The absolute Omnipotence manifests itself as it likes and
appears to us; and all its powers are exhibited in one form or
other to our view and understandings.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. These powers are of many kinds, and are primarily concentrated
in the Divine Soul or Spirit. The potentialities (or <i>potes esse</i>)
are the Active and Passive powers, also the Rational and
Irrational and all others.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. These varieties of powers are the inventions of the learned for
their own purpose and understanding; but there is no distinction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>of them in the Divine Spirit. (All diversities are one and the
same to the unity of God (<i>omne ens—to en—est unum.</i> And again,
<i>Qua ens est indivisum in se, divisum ab omnialio</i>)).</p>

<p class='c009'>7. There is no duality in reality, the difference consists in
shape and not in substantiality. Thus the waves in the waters
of the sea, the bracelets and wristlets formed of gold, are no
more than modifications of the same substances.</p>

<p class='c009'>(All formal differences terminate in the material, and this
again in the immaterial Spirit of God).</p>

<p class='c009'>8. The form of a thing is said to be so and so, from its
appearance only and not in its reality. The snake is affirmed
of a rope, but we have neither the outward perception nor inward
thought of a snake in it. Hence all appearances are delusions
of sense.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. It is the universal soul that shows itself in some form or
other, to our deluded senses and understandings, and this also
according to our different apprehensions of the same thing (as
what appears as gold to one, seems as brass to another).</p>

<p class='c009'>10. It is the ignorant only that understand the Omniform
God, to be all forms of things; while the learned know
the forms to be modifications of the various powers of
the Almighty, and not the figures themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. Now whether the forms (of material things) be real or
unreal, it is to be known that they appear to men according
to their different apprehensions of those beings, which Brahma
is pleased to exhibit in any particular form to their minds and
senses. (<i>i.e.</i> Some taking an abstract and others a concrete view
of them, agreeably to their internal conceptions or external
perceptions, of their various properties and qualities).</p>

</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> resumed:—The supreme Deity is the all-pervading
spirit and the great God and Lord of all. He is without
beginning and end, and is self-same with the infinite
bliss of his translucent self-cogitation.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. It is this supreme felicity and purely intellectual substance,
whence the living soul and mind have their rise, prior to
their production of the Universe. (<i>i.e.</i> The eternal and
inert bliss called Brahma, became the living soul—anima,
of and the active mind—mens, which created the world).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Ráma asked:—How could the self-cogitation of Brahma, as
the infinite spirit and one without a second, conceive in
it a finite living soul other than itself, and which was
not in Being.</p>

<p class='c009'>(The inactive and active souls, are not the one and the same thing,
nor can the immutable and infinite be changed to one of a finite
and changeful nature; nor was there a secondary being co-existent
with the unity of the self-existent God).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Vasishtha replied:—The immense and transparent Spirit of
Brahma, remained in a state of <i>asat</i>—non-existence, a state
of ineffable bliss as seen by the adept Yogi; but of formidable
vastness as conceived by the uninitiated novice. (<i>i.e.</i> The
meditation of the Infinite is a delight to the spiritualist, but
it is a horror to the gross idolator, whose mind knows nothing
beyond matter and material forms).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. This state of supreme bliss, which is ever tranquil, and
full with the pure essence of God, is altogether undefinable,
and incomprehensible, even by the most proficient in divine
knowledge. (God is unknowable, is the motto of the wise
Athenians and modern Agnostics).</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Thence sprang a power (an hypostasis) like the germ of a
seed, and possessed of consciousness and energy, that is called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>the living and conscious soul, and which must last until its
final liberation. (This is the Demiurge, an emanation from God,
and the source and soul of the world).</p>

<p class='c009'>7. The clear mirror of the mind of this being, reflected in its
vast vacuous sphere, the images of innumerable worlds set above
one another, like statues engraved upon it.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Know Ráma! the living soul to be an inflation of Divine
Spirit, like the swelling of the sea and the burning of a
candle, when its flame is unshaken by the wind.</p>

<p class='c009'>(The <i>psyche</i> or <i>anima</i> is the energy of the universal
soul, or the finite rising from the Infinite).</p>

<p class='c009'>9. The living soul is possessed of a finite cognoscence as
distinguished from the clear and calm consciousness of the Divine
Spirit. Its vitality is a flash of the vacuous intellect of Brahma
and appertaining to the nature of the living God. <i>Divina particula
aurae.</i> The Lord says: ‘<i>Aham asmi</i>—I am that I am’; but
the living soul knows itself to be ‘<i>Soham asmi</i>’—I am He
or of Him.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. Vitality is the essential property of the soul, resembling
the inseparable properties of motion in the wind, warmth in the
fire and coldness in the ice. (Animation is the natural faculty
and necessary property of the soul).</p>

<p class='c009'>11. Our ignorance of the nature of the Divine Intellect and
Spirit, throws us to the knowledge of ourselves by our
self-consciousness, and this it is, which is called the
living soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>(Beyond our conscious or subjective knowledge of ourselves, we
know nothing of the subjectivity of God, nor are we certain
of any objective reality).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. It is by means of this positive consciousness, that we know
our egoism or self-existence; it strikes us more glaringly
than a spark of fire, and enlightens us to the knowledge of
ourselves more than any other light.</p>

<p class='c009'>(Our self-consciousness is the clearest of all knowledge,
and the basis of all truth according to Descartes).</p>

<p class='c009'>13. As in looking up to heaven, its blue vault is presented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>to the sight, beyond which our eyes have not the power to
pierce; so in our inquiry into the nature of soul, we see no
more than the consciousness of ourselves, and nothing besides.
(<i>i.e.</i> The subjective soul only is knowable, and naught
beyond it).</p>

<p class='c009'>14. Our knowledge of the soul presents to us in the form of <i>Ego</i>
known by its thoughts, like the vacuous sky appearing as a blue
sphere by cause of the clouds. (The Ego is the subject of thoughts
and self-cogitation).</p>

<p class='c009'>15. Egoism differentiates the soul from our ideas of space and
time, and stirs within it like the breath of winds, by reason of
its subjectivity of thoughts. (Differentiation of the subjective
Ego from the Objective space and time, is as the difference of Ego
and Non-Ego, I and Not I, Le moi et non moi, Das Ich und nicht
ich, Aham and twam &amp;c.).</p>

<p class='c009'>16. That which is the subject of thoughts, is known as the Ego,
and is <a id="variously"></a>variously styled as the intellect, the soul, the mind,
the máyá or delusion and Prakriti or nature. (The Ego personified
is Rudra, the personification of <i>chitta</i>-cogitation is Vishnu,
of Jíva or the soul is Brahmá, and of the <i>manas</i> or mind is
the máyá or Illusion).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. The mind (chetas) which is the subject of thoughts,
contemplates on the nature of elementary matter, and thus
becomes of itself the quintessence of the five elements.</p>

<p class='c009'>(The mind is opposed to matter, but being the principle of
volition produces matter at its will).</p>

<p class='c009'>18. The quintessential mind next becomes as a spark of fire
(of itself), and remains as a dim star—a nebula, in the midst
of the vacuity of the yet unborn universe.</p>

<p class='c009'>(The nebulae are the primary formations of heavenly bodies,
called Brahmándas or mundane eggs).</p>

<p class='c009'>19. The mind takes the form of a spark of fire by thinking
on its essence, which gradually developes itself like the germ
of a seed, in the form of the mundane egg by its internal
force.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>(The doctrine of evolution from fire, the <i>arche</i> of all
things according to Heraclitus. Lewe’s Hist. Ph. I 72).</p>

<p class='c009'>20. The same fiery spark figuratively called the Brahmánda
or mundane egg, became as a snowball amidst the water, and
conceived the great Brahmá within its hollow womb.</p>

<p class='c009'>(The Spirit of God, dove-like, sat brooding over the hollow
deep. Milton).</p>

<p class='c009'>21. Then as sensuous spirits assume some bodily forms at
pleasure, although they dissolve as a magic city in empty air;
so this Brahmá appeared in an embodied form to view. (Spirits
are at liberty to take upon them any form they like).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. Some of them appear in the form of immovable, and others
in those of moving beings; while others assume the shapes of
aerials, as they are fond of choosing for themselves. (Hence
the transmigration of souls in different bodies, depends on
their own choice; and not on necessity or result of prior acts).</p>

<p class='c009'>23. Thus the first born living being had a form, for himself as
he liked in the beginning of creation, and afterwards created
the world in his form of Brahma or Virinchi (Vir-incipiens).
(The Demiurge, maker, creator or architect of the visible world,
had necessarily a personality of his own).</p>

<p class='c009'>24. Whatever the self-born and self-willed soul, wishes to
produce, the same appears immediately to view as produced of its
own accord. (Everything appeared of itself at the Fiat of God).</p>

<p class='c009'>25. Brahmá, originating in the Divine Intellect, was by his
nature the primary cause of all, without any cause of his own;
though he appointed the acts of men; to be the cause of their
transition from one state to another, in the course of the
world.</p>

<p class='c009'>(All the future states of beings depend on their acts of past
and present lives, except that of the Great creator who is
uncreated and unchangeable).</p>

<p class='c009'>26. The thoughts naturally rise in the mind, like the foaming
water, to subside in itself; but the acts done thereby, bind
us, as the passing froth and flying birds are caught by ropes
and snares.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>(The thoughts are spontaneous in their growth as grass, and
they entail no guilt on us. Shakespeare).</p>

<p class='c009'>27. Thoughts are the seeds of action, and action is the soul
of life. Past acts are productive of future consequence, but
inaction is attended with no result. (Our lives are reckoned
by our acts, and there is no vitality without activity).</p>

<p class='c009'>28. The living soul bears its vitality as the seed bears the
germ in its bosom; and this sprouts forth in future acts, in
the manner of the various forms of leaves, fruits and flowers
of trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>(Thus the living soul of Brahmá was the seed of all animate
and inanimate beings).</p>

<p class='c009'>29. All other living souls that appeared in the various forms of
their bodies, had such forms given to them by Brahmá, according
to their acts and desires in premundane creations in former
Kalpas. (Hence the belief in the endless succession of creations).</p>

<p class='c009'>30. So the personal acts of people are the causes of their
repeated births and deaths in this or other worlds; and they
ascend higher or sink lower by virtue of their good or bad deeds,
which proceed from their hearts and the nature of their souls.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. Our actions are the efforts of our minds, and shape our good
or bad destinies according to the merit or demerit of the acts.
The fates and chances of all in the existing world, are the fruits
and flowers of their past acts, and even of those done in prior
Kalpas; and this is called their destiny. (Sástra: No act goes
for naught even in a thousand <i>Kalpas</i>. Má bhuktan kshiyate
Karma, kalpa koti satai rapi).</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. The mind and its operations, the subjective
and objective, and lastly the Divine Intellect.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> continued:—The Mind sprang at first from
the supreme cause of all; this mind is the active soul which
resides in the supreme soul (the Ens entium).
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. The mind hangs in doubt between what is and what is not,
and what is right and what is wrong. It forgets the past
like the scent of a fleeting odor by its wilful negligence.
(Unmindfulness is the cause of forgetfulness).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Yet there is no difference between these seeming contraries;
because the dualities of Brahma and the soul, the mind and máyá,
the agent and act, and the phenomenal and noumenal worlds, all
blend together in the unity of God. (All seeming differences
converge in unvarying Mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. There is but one Universal soul displaying its Intellect as a
vast ocean, and extending its consciousness as a sea of unlimited
extent. (These extend to all beings in the universe).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. What is true and real shines forth amidst all that is
untrue and unreal; so does the subjective essence of the mind
subsist amidst all its airy and fleeting dreams in sleep. And
thus the world is both true and untrue as regards its subsistence
in God and its external phenomena. (The substance is real but
the appearance is false).</p>

<p class='c009'>6. The erroneous conception either of the reality or unreality
of the outer world, does not spring in the mind, which is conscious
of its operations only, and of no outward phenomena. This
conception is like the deception of a magic show, and is
concomitant with all sensuous minds.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. It is the long habit of thinking the unreal world as real,
that makes it appear as such, to the unthinking, as a protracted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>sleep makes its visionary scenes appear as true to the dreaming
soul. It is the want of reflection, that causes us to mistake a
man in a block of wood.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Want of spiritual light misleads the mind from its
rationality, and makes it take its false imaginations for
true; as children are impressed with a belief of ghosts in
shadows, through their fear and want of true knowledge.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. The mind is inclined of its own tendency, to assign a
living soul (and also a body) to the Divine Spirit; which
is devoid of appellation, form or figure, and <a id="is_beyond"></a>is beyond
our comprehension; (and is styled the Incomprehensible).</p>

<p class='c009'>10. Knowledge of the living state (personality), leads to that of
Egoism which is the cause of intellection. This again introduces
the sensations and finally the sensible body. (Ego is the
subject of thoughts).</p>

<p class='c009'>11. This bondage of the soul in body, necessitates a heaven
and hell for want of its liberation and then the acts of the body,
become the seeds of our endless transmigrations in this world.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. As there is no difference between the soul, intellect and
life, so there is no duality in the living soul and intellect, nor
in the body and its acts, which are inseparable from each other.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. Acts are the causes of bodies, and the body is not the
mind; the mind is one with egoism, and the ego is the living
soul. The living soul is one with the Divine Intellect and
this soul is all and the lord God of all.</p>

Argument. Origin and Nature of Duality
and the Manner of its Extinction.</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>hus</span> Ráma! there is one true essence, which appears many
by our mistake; and this variety is caused by the production
of one from the other, as one lamp is lighted from another.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. By knowing one’s self as nothing as it was before its
coming to being, and by considering the falsity of his notions
(of his reality), no one can have any cause of grief (at its
loss). (The Sruti:—The knower of the true-self, is above all
grief and sorrow).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Man is but a being of his own conception, and by getting rid
of this concept, he is freed from his idea of the duality of the
world (as a distinct existence); just as one with his shoes on,
perceives the whole earth he treads upon, to be covered over with
skin.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. As the plantain tree has no pith except its manifold coats,
so there is no substantiality of the world beside our false
conceptions of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Our births are followed by childhood, youth, old age and
death one after the other, and then opens the prospect of a heaven
or hell to our view, like passing phantoms before the flighty mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. As the clear eye sees bubbles of light in the empty sky,
so the thoughtless mind views the firmament full of luminous
bodies (which are but phantoms of the brain).</p>

<p class='c009'>7. As the one moon appears as two to the dimsighted eye, so the
intellect, vitiated by influence of the senses, sees a duality
in the unity of the supreme spirit.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. As the giddiness of wine presents the pictures of trees
before the drunken eye, so does the inebriation of sensation,
present the phantoms of the world before the excited intellect.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>9. Know the revolution of the visible world, to resemble the
revolving wheel of a potter’s mill; which they turn about in
play as the rotatory ball of a terrestrial globe.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. When the intellect thinks of another thing (as matter)
beside itself, it then falls into the error of dualism; but when
it concentrates its thoughts in itself, it then loses the sense
of the objective duality.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. There is nothing beside the Intellect except the thoughts
on which it dwells; and its sensations are all at rest, as it
comes to know the nihility of objects.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. When the weak intellect is quiet by its union with
the Supreme, and by suppression of its functions, it is then
called <i>sansánta</i>—or quiescent or insouciant.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. It is the weak intellect that thinks of the thinkables,
but the sound understanding ceases from all thoughts; as it is
a slight intoxication that makes one rave and revel about, while
deep drinking is dead to all excitements.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. When the sound and consummate understanding, runs in
one course towards its main reservoir of the supreme; it
becomes divested of its knowledge of the knowables, and of its
self-consciousness also in the presence of the one and no other.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. The perfected understanding finds the errors, to which it
is exposed by its sensation of the sensibles; and comes to know,
that birth and life and all the acts and sights of the living
state, are as false as dreams.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. The mind being repressed from its natural flight, can
have no thought of any thing; and is lost in itself; as the
natural heat of fire and motion of the wind being extinct,
they are annihilated of themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. Without the suppression of mental operations, the mind
must continue in its misconceptions, as that of mistaking
a rope for a snake through ignorance.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. It is not difficult to repress the action of the mind and
rouse our consciousness; in order to heal our souls of the
malady of their mistaken notion of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>19. If you can succeed to suppress the desires of your
restless mind at any time, you are sure to obtain your
liberation even at the very moment and without fail.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. If you will but turn to the side of your subjective
consciousness only, you will get rid of the objective
world, in the same manner as one is freed from his fear
of snake in a rope, by his examination of the thing.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. If it is possible to get rid of the restless mind, which
is the source of all our desires; it is no way impossible to
attain to the chief end of liberation to any.</p>

<p class='c009'>22. When highminded men are seen to give up their lives as
straws (in an honorable cause), there is no reason why they
should be reluctant to abandon their desires for the sake of
their chief good of liberation.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. Remain unfettered by forsaking the desires of your
greedy mind; for what is the good of getting sensible
objects, which we are sure to lose (some time or other).</p>

<p class='c009'>24. The liberated are already in the sight of the immortality
of their souls and of God, as one who has got a fruit in his
hand, or sees a mountain palpable before him.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. It is the Spirit of God alone, that abides in everything
in these phenomenal worlds, which rise to view like the waves
of the waters of the great deluge. It is his knowledge that
is attended with the <i>summum bonum</i> of liberation, and it is
ignorance of that supreme Being, that binds the mind to the
interminable bondage of the world.</p>

Argument. Nature of the Active and <i>Living</i> Soul
(Jíva) and its Sensations.</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">R</span>áma</span> said:—Leaving the mind please tell me more about the
nature of the living soul; what relation it bears to the
Supreme soul, how it sprang from the same and what is its
essence.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Vasishtha replied:—Know Brahma is omnipresent, and the
Lord of all at all times; He manifests himself in whatever
attribute he assumes to himself at his free will. Ex arbitrio suo.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. The attribute which the universal soul assumes to itself
in the form of perception (chétana), is known by the term
living soul, which possesses the power of volition in itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. There are two causal principles combined with the living soul,
namely: its predestination resulting from its prior acts and
volitions; and its later free will which branch forth severally
into the various causes of birth, death and subsistence of
beings.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Ráma said:—Such being the case, tell me, O thou greatest of
sages, what this predestination means and what are these acts,
and how they become the causal agents of subsequent events.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Vasishtha replied:—The intellect (chit) is possest of its own
nature of the properties of oscillation and rest, like the vacillation
and stillness of the winds in the air. Its agitation is the cause of
its action, otherwise it is calm and quiet as a dead lock—<i>quietus</i>
itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Its oscillation appears in the fluctuation of the mind, and
its calmness in the want of mental activity and exertions; as
in the nonchalance of Yoga quietism.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. The vibrations of the intellect lead to its continual
transmigrations; and its quietness settles it in the state
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>of the immovable Brahma. The oscillation of the intellect is
known to be the cause of the living state and all its actions.</p>

<p class='c009'>(The moving force of the mind is the animism of Stahl, and
its rest is the <i>quietus</i> of Plato).</p>

<p class='c009'>9. This vibrative intellect is the thinking Soul, and is known as
the living agent of actions; and the primary seed of the universe.
(This is the <i>anima mundi</i> or moving force of the world,—the
doctrine of Stahl).</p>

<p class='c009'>10. This secondary soul then assumes a luminous form according
to the light of its intellect, and afterwards becomes multifarious
at its will, and by means of the pulsations of the primary
intellect all over the creation. (This luminous form is represented
by the red body of Brahma and the red clay of which Adam was formed.
(It was the All—<i>to pan</i> of Pantheism, and the <i>Principium
hylarchicum</i> or first principle of Henry Moore)).</p>

<p class='c009'>11. The pulsative intellect or soul, having passed through many
transformations (or transmigrations), is at last freed from its
motion and migration. And there are some souls which pass into a
thousand births and forms, while there are others which obtain
their liberation in a single birth (by means of their Yoga
meditation or unification with God, which is the final aim of
Platonism and of the Chinese Laosin).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. So also the human soul being of its own nature prone to
assume its dualism of the motive intellect, becomes by itself
the cause of its transmigration and sufferings, as also of its
transient bliss or misery in heaven or hell. (There is no rest for
the restless soul, until it rests in the bosom of the all-tranquil
and Universal soul).</p>

<p class='c009'>13. As the same gold is changed to the forms of bracelets
and other things, and as the same gross matter appears in the
different forms of wood and stone; so the uniform soul of God
appears as multiform according to his various modes and attributes.
(The soul modifies itself into many forms of activity
and passivity).</p>

<p class='c009'>14. It is the fallacy of the human mind, that views the forms as
realities, and causes one to think his soul which is freed from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>birth and form, to be born, living and dead, as a man sees a city
to rise and fall in his delirium. (The appearances and forms of
things are objective and false fabrications of the intellect).</p>

<p class='c009'>15. The varying intellect erroneously conceives its unreal egoism
and <i>meitatem</i> as realities, from its ignorance of its unity
with the unchangeable reality of God, and also from its felicity
of enjoyments peculiar to its varied state. (The भोगाशा or desire
of fruition is the cause of the revolution of the soul in endless
states of beings).</p>

<p class='c009'>16. As Lavana the King of Mathura, falsely deemed himself
as a Chandála, so the intellect thinks on its own different
states of existence and that of the world (from its desire
of enjoying its pleasures which are deeply rooted in itself).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. All this world is the phantom of an erroneous imagination,
O Ráma! it is no more than the swelling of the waters
of the deep. (The world is the expansion of the self-same soul
and its evolution is the volition of Brahma).</p>

<p class='c009'>18. The intellect is ever busied with the intellection of its
own intelligences, and the innate principles of its action; in the
same manner as the sea is seen to swell with its waters moving
in waves of themselves. (The continuation of the intellect in
the association of its preconceived ideas, is carried on by law
of continuity).</p>

<p class='c009'>19. The intellect is as the water in the wide expanse of
Brahma; its inflation raises the waving thoughts in the mind,
resembling the bubbles of water, and produces the revolutions
of living souls like eddies in the sea of this world.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. Know thy soul, O gentle Ráma! as a phenomenon of the
all pervading Brahma, who is both the subject and object of his
consciousness, and who has posited in thee a particle of himself,
like the breath of a mighty lion.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. The intellect with its consciousness, constitutes the living
soul, and that with the will forms the mind; its knowing power
is the understanding, and its retentiveness is called its memory:
its subjectivity of selfishness is styled egoism, and its error is
called <i>máyá</i> or delusion. (Consciousness is perception <span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span><i>qua mens
de presenti suo statu admonitur</i>. The living soul is psyche or
animus. The intellect is the mover of the will. The <i>intellectus</i>
est prior voluntate, non enimést voluntas &amp;c. The understanding
has the power to acquire knowledge, and memory has the power of
retention &amp;c.).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. The mind by its imagination stretches out this world,
which is as false as the phantom of Utopia—Gandharva-nagaram
or an air drawn city.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. The objective knowledge of the world in the mind, is as
false as the appearance of chains of pearls in the sky, and as
the visionary scenes in a dream. (The objective is the feigned
fabrication of the mind, and therefore unreal).</p>

<p class='c009'>24. The soul which is ever pure and self sufficient in its nature,
and remains in its own state of tranquility; is not perceived
by the perverted mind dwelling on its delusive dreams.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. The objective world is referred to waking—Jágrat, because
it is perceived in the waking state of the soul; and the
subjective mind is allied to sleep—<i>swapna</i>, because the mind is
active during the sleeping and dreaming states. The ego is related
to deep sleep—<i>sushupta</i>, when we are unconscious of ourselves,
and the fourth or pure Intellect—<i>turíya</i> or <i>turya</i>, is the
trance or hybernation of the soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. That which is above these four conditions, is the state of
ultimate bliss, <i>ecstasis</i>; and it is by reliance on that
supremely pure essence of God, that one is exempted from all his
causes of grief and sorrow (in his ecstatic delight).</p>

<p class='c009'>27. Everything is displayed in Him and all things are
absorbed in Him also; this world is neither a reality here
or there; it presents only the false appearance of strings
of pearls in the sky. (Sensible forms are empty appearances,
and are only believed as real by materialists).</p>

<p class='c009'>28. And yet God is said to be the cause and substratum, of
all these unobstructed phantoms rising to the view, as the
empty air is said to be the receptacle of the rising trees.
Thus the uncausal God is said to be the cause of this uncaused
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>world, which only exists in our illusive conceptions, and
presents itself to our delusive sensations of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>29. As a polished piece of iron gets the reflexion of a grosser
piece, so do our finer or inner sensations take the representations
of the gross forms of their particular objects (though the
senses and sensible objects are both untrue, as mere delusive and
delusions).</p>

<p class='c009'>30. These sensations are conveyed to the mind, and thence again
to the living soul and intellect, in the same manner as the
roots supply the sap to the stem, and thence to the branches,
and lastly to the fruits of trees. (<i>i.e.</i> The Divine Intellect
is the last receptacle of the impressions of the senses).</p>

<p class='c009'>31. As the seed produces the fruit, and the same contains the
seed in itself; so the intellect producing the mind and its
thoughts can not get rid of them; but is contained in, and
reproduced by them in successive transmigrations.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. There is some difference however in the simile of the
insensible seed and tree; with the sensible intellect and
mind (which are freed from reproduction by their attainment
of liberation); but the thoughts of the creator and creation
like the seed and tree, are reproductive of one another without
end. (Because the thought of the creator accompanies that of the
creation, and so the <i>viceversa</i>; owing to the unbroken chain and
interminable concatenation of the ideas of causality and its
effect).</p>

<p class='c009'>33. But there is this difference between the insensible seed
and sensible intellect, that the former is continually productive
of one another, while the latter ceases in its process upon its
attainment of liberation; yet the ideas of the creator and
creation are reproductive of each other <i>adinfinitum</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. Yet our understanding shows it as clearly—as the sun light
sets forth the forms and colours of objects to view; that there
is one eternal God of truth, who is of the form of intellectual
light, which shows the forms of all things, that proceed
from Him (as the colours of objects originate from the solar
light, and are shown again by the same to our optical vision).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>35. As the ground which is dug presents a hollow, so the
reasoning of every system of sound philosophy establishes the
existence of the transcendental void as the cause of all. (An
unknown first cause without any attribute, is the unanimous
conclusion, arrived at every rational system of Philosophy.
See Kusumánjali. Here Vasishtha establishes his vacuous
rather than a personal cause).</p>

<p class='c009'>36. As a prismatic crystal represents various colours in its
prisms, without being tinged by the same; so the transparent
essence of Brahma shows the groups of worlds in its hollow
bosom without its connection with them. (This variety of
vision is caused by our optical deception).</p>

<p class='c009'>37. The universal soul is the source, and not the substance
of all these vast masses of worlds; just as the seed is the
embryo, and not the matter of the trees and plants and their
fruits and flowers that grow from the same. (The <i>to on</i> is
the only principle called God, all other objects are but
phenomenal modifications of his essence).</p>

<p class='c009'>38. Ráma said:—Oh how wonderful is this world, which presents
its unreality as a reality in all its endless forms unto
us; and though situated in the Divine self, appears to be
quite apart from it. O how it makes its minuteness seem so
very immense to us. (What are these worlds but as particles
subsisting in the divine essence, when they are compared with
the immensity of the Divine spirit and mind—the finite with
the Infinite).</p>

<p class='c009'>39. I see how this shadowy scene of the world appearing in the
Divine soul, and becoming as an orb, by virtue of the ideal
<i>tanmátras</i> or particles of the divine essence in it. I find
it as a snow ball or icicle made of frozen frost.</p>

<p class='c009'>40. Now tell me Sir, how the spiritual particles increase in
bulk, and in what manner the body of the self born Brahmá was
produced from Brahma. Say also in what manner do these
objects in nature come to existence in their material forms.</p>

<p class='c009'>(Brahmá the Demiurgus was an emanation of God according
to Gnostics; and Vaishwánara was the same as the soul of
the world according to Plotinus).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>41. Vasishtha replied:—Too incredible is this form and
without a parallel, which sprang of itself from its own essence.
It is altogether inconceivable how some thing is produced of its
own conception.</p>

<p class='c009'>42. Just fancy, O Ráma! how the unexpanded phantom of a
Vetála or ghost, swells in bigness to the sight of fearful
children; and conceive in the same manner the appearance of
the living spirit from the entity of Brahma. (Evolution of
the Living God from the inert Brahma, is as the springing
of the moving spirit from the dormant soul).</p>

<p class='c009'>43. This living spirit was a development of Brahma—the
universal soul; it was holy and a commensurable and finite
being, and having a personality of its own; it remained as
an impersonal unreality in the essence of the selfexistent
God. Being separated afterwards from its source, it had a
different appellation given to it. (This is the Holy spirit
or ghost in one sense, as also the Divine <i>Logos</i> in another,
and in whom there was life).</p>

<p class='c009'>44. As Brahma the all extended and infinite soul, became the
definite living soul at will; so the living spirit, became the
mind by its volition afterwards. (There is a trinity or triple
division of the soul into <i>soma</i> or the universal soul, the
<i>pneuma</i> or anima or the living spirit, and the <i>nous</i> or
mens or mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>45. The mind which was the principle of intellection, took a
form of its own; and so likewise the life assumed an airy form
in the midst of vacuity. (The mind is the state of the impersonal
soul with a sense of its personality, and life is animation or
the vital principle in the form of the vital breath).</p>

<p class='c009'>46. The wakeful living god (who had no twinkling of his eyes),
whereby we measure time was yet conscious of its course by
means of his thoughts; and had the notion of a brilliant
icicle of the form of the future mundane egg in his mind.
See Manu’s Genesis of the World. I.</p>

<p class='c009'>47. Then the living soul felt in itself the sense of its
consciousness, and by thinking ‘what am I,’ was conscious of
its egoism. (Why is the non-ego of the objective world put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>before the ego? The objective orb of the world should follow
the subjective consciousness).</p>

<p class='c009'>48. This god next found in his understanding the knowledge of
the word taste, and got the notion of its becoming the object
of a particular organ of sense, to be hereafter called “the
tongue.” (<i>Rasaná</i> or the instrument of the perception of <i>rasa</i>
or flavour. <i>Rasa</i> abiding in water is reckoned first of the elements
on account the Spirit of God resting on it before creation,
wherefore God is himself called <i>rasa</i> in the Sruti—<i>rasa vaitat</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>49. The living soul then found out in his mind the meaning of
the word ‘light,’ which was afterwards to sparkle in the eye—the
particular organ of sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>(The Bible says, <i>lux fiat et lux fit</i>—Light to be the first work
of creation; though the Vedas give Priority to water as in the
passages “<i>apa eva sasarjádau</i>”, Manu. <i>Yasrishtih Srasturádyá.</i>
Sakuntala).</p>

<p class='c009'>50. Next the god came to know in his mind the property of
smell, and the organ of smelling; as also the substance of
earth to which it appertains as its inseparable property. (The
Nyaya says: <i>prithví gandhavatí</i>—the earth is smelling. It
followed the creation of light).</p>

<p class='c009'>51. In this manner the living soul, came to be acquainted at
once with the other sensations, and the organs to which they
appertain as their inseparable properties and objects. (The word
<i>bhavitá</i> means the spontaneous growth of these faculties in the
soul or mind, and <i>kákatálíya</i> signifies the simultaneous occurrence
of the senses, and sensible objects, and their sensations in the mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>52. The unsubstantial living spirit which derives its being
from the essence of the substantial Brahma, comes next to
acquire the knowledge of sound, the object of the organ of
hearing, and the property of air. (So Nyáya:—“<i>ákásh sabdádharah</i>”;
and “<i>yá Sruti visaya gunáh</i>”—Sakuntala).</p>

<p class='c009'><a id="53"></a>53. It then comes to understand the meaning of the word
touch (twak) as the medium of feeling, as also to know the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>tongue as the only organ of taste. (According to schoolmen,
taste is the object of the palate and not of the tongue).</p>

<p class='c009'>53. It finds the property of colour to be the peculiar object of
the eye—the organ of sight; and that of smell to be an object
peculiar to the nose—the organ of the sense of smelling (ghránendriya).</p>

<p class='c009'>54. The living soul is thus the common receptacle of the sensations,
and source of the senses, which it developes afterwards in the organs
of sense in the body. It perceives the sensation of sensible objects
through the perceptive holes, that convey their perceptions into the
sensorium of the mind. (The common sensory is variously placed in
Western philosophy, such as the heart, brain, pineal gland, the
ventrialis &amp;c.).</p>

<p class='c009'>55. Such, O Ráma! as it was with the first animated being, is still
so with all living animals; and all these sensations are represented
in the Soul of the world—<i>anima mundi</i>, in its spiritual
form—<i>átiváhika</i>, known as the <i>súkshma</i> or <i>lingadeha</i>—the subtle
body. (The spiritual body has 17 organs of sense viz, 5 Internal,
5 External, the mind and Intellect and others (called <i>the saptadasha
lingátmaka linga saríra</i>)).</p>

<p class='c009'>56. The nature of this abstruse essence, is as undefinable as
that of the spirit; it appears to be in motion, when it is really
at rest, as in our idea of the soul. (Spiritual bodies are said to
move and fly about, because the spirit is the motive, and life
the animating principle as the soul is that of consciousness).</p>

<p class='c009'>57. As measure and dimensions are foreign, to our notion of
Brahma—the all conscious soul, so are they quite apart from that
of the spirit also, which is no more than the motive power of the
soul. (Magnitude, figure, motion, rest, number, place, distance,
position, &amp;c. are all objects of the senses).</p>

<p class='c009'>58. As the notion of the spiritual, is distinct from that of
all others which are material and corporeal; so the notion of
Brahma is quite apart from every thing, except that of his
self-consciousness.</p>

<p class='c009'>(God says in the Scripture, “I am that I am,” which proves
his consciousness of himself to constitute his essence).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>59. Ráma said:—If consciousness is self-same with Brahma, and
our consciousness of ourselves as Brahma, make us identic
with Brahma Himself; then what is the use of devising a
duality of the soul (as the divine and human souls), or of
talking of the liberation and final absorption of the one in
the other? (If what the Sruti says, Brahmásmi—I am Brahma; as
the scripture declares—“In Him we live and move,” then what
means our redemption or return to Him?).</p>

<p class='c009'>60. Vasishtha replied:—Ráma, your question is irrelevant at
this time, when I was going to prove another thing. Nothing
can be appropriate out of its proper time and place, as the
untimely offering of flowers to gods is not acceptable to
them. (A question beside the mark is <i>apropos de bottes</i>, and
brought in by the head and shoulders).</p>

<p class='c009'>61. A word full of meaning, becomes meaningless out of its
proper place; like the offering of flowers to gods and guests,
out of their proper season. (So all intempestivous acts, go
<i>mal a propos</i>, unless they are done in proper time).</p>

<p class='c009'>62. There is a time for the introducing of a subject, and
another to hold silence over it; so every thing becomes
fruitful in its proper season. (Tempus coronat opus).</p>

<p class='c009'>63. But to resume our subject; the living soul afterwards
appeared from Him, as the human soul appears in dreaming;
and thought in himself that he was the great father of
created beings in time to come. (<i>i.e.</i> He would become
the Maker of the world).</p>

<p class='c009'>64. He uttered the syllable Om (on or ens), and was conscious
of the verification of its meaning in his mind, which soon
displayed all forms of beings to his mental vision. (<i>i.e.</i> The
All One became many, which displayed themselves in the mind
of the living God as visions in a dream).</p>

<p class='c009'>65. All these were unrealities, that were displayed in the
empty sphere of the divine mind; and the shadowy world seemed
as a huge mountain, floating before him in the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>66. It was neither born of itself, nor was made by Brahmá;
nor is it destroyed at any time by any other power. It was
Brahma himself, appearing as the phantom of an aerial city.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>67. As the living Brahmá and other spiritual beings, are
unreal in their nature; so also are the essences of other beings,
from the big giant to the little emmet, but mere unrealities
in their substance.</p>

<p class='c009'>68. It is our erroneous understanding, that represents these
unrealities as real ones unto us; but the clear understanding will
find all things, from the great Brahmá down to the minutest insect,
to vanish entirely from its sight. (Errors of the mind breed
errors in the brain; and these lead to errors of vision again).</p>

<p class='c009'>69. The same cause that produces Brahmá, produces the insects
also; and it is the greater depravity of the mind, that causes
its transmigration, into the contemptible forms of worms.</p>

<p class='c009'>70. The living being that is possest of a rational soul, and
is devoted to the cultivation of the mind, attains to the state
of man; and then acts righteously for attaining a better state in
after life. (These are the states of gods and angels in heaven).</p>

<p class='c009'>71. It is wrong to suppose one’s elevation, to be owing to the
merit of his acts, and his degradation to the condition of worms,
to result from his former acts of demerit; because there is the
same particle of intellect in both of them, and this being known,
will destroy the mistaken difference between the great and
small.</p>

<p class='c009'>72. The notions of the measurer, measure and measurable, are
not separate from the intellect (or mind); therefore the controversy
of unity and duality, is as futile as the horns of a hare or
a lake of lotuses in the air. (This means the ideas of the
producer, production and product, are always one in the
Absolute subjective. Schelling).</p>

<p class='c009'>73. It is our misconception of the blissful Brahma, that produces
the wrong notion of solid substances in us; and this imagination
of our own making, binds us as fast as the silk-worms are
fast bound in the cocoons; formed by their own serum (or ichor
or serosity).</p>

<p class='c009'>74. It is the case of the knower, to perceive everything in
his mind, as it is revealed in it by Brahma; and also to meet
with every thing as it is allotted by God to his share. (God
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>is the revealer and giver of all things. Or—Man meets his fate,
as it is meted to him by his Maker).</p>

<p class='c009'>75. It is the immutable law of nature, that nothing can be
otherwise than what it is ordained to be; and there is nothing
in nature, which can change its nature for a minute in a whole
kalpa-age. (Nature derives her power from the will of her
Maker, and her course is, according to the immutable order,
fixed by the ordainer of all).</p>

<p class='c009'>76. And yet this creation is a false phantom, and so is the
growth and dissolution of all created beings, as also our
enjoyment of them. (All visible Nature is the working of
the invisible Spirit).</p>

<p class='c009'>77. Brahma is pure, all pervading, infinite and absolute.
It is for our misery only, that we take him for the impure
matter and unreal substance; and as the definite and limited
pluralities.</p>

<p class='c009'>78. It is the vitiated imagination of boys, that fancies the
water and its waves as different things; and makes a false
distinction between them which are really the same things.
(Hence whatever differences there appear in objects, they are
all as the fallacy of a snake in the rope with the unknowing.
There is no difference of antagonistic powers felt in the
spirit of Brahma, who is equal in all, and to whom all things
are equal; though there seems a constant opposition in the
natures of things).</p>

<p class='c009'>79. It is His undivided self which expanded itself in visible
nature, and which appears as a duality, like that of the waves and
the sea, and the bracelets and gold. Thus He of himself appears
as other than himself. (<i>i.e.</i> The difference appearing in the
visibles, disappears in the indifference of the Divine Mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>80. We are led to imagine the visible and mutable world,
to have sprung from the invisible and immutable spirit, which
manifested itself in the form of the mind that produced the Ego.
Thus we have the visible from the invisible, and the mind and
the ego from the same source. (The absolute Brahma manifesting
itself in two forms, the mind or ego and nature or non-ego.
The Ego of the mind is infinite, which produced the finite ego
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>or human soul, personified as the first male (Adimapurusha or
Adam)).</p>

<p class='c009'>81. The mind joined with the ego, produced the notions of
elementary principles or elemental particles; which the living
soul combined with its intellect, derived from the main source
of Brahma, and of which it formed the phenomenal world.
(These notions were the intentive concepts of the formal and
reflexive world, existing primordially in the essence of Brahma,
as its material cause or (<i>upádánam</i>). So says the Vedánta:—<i>Yato
viswamvá imámi bhutani &amp;c.</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>82. Thus the mind being realised from Brahma, sees before it
whatever it imagines; and whatever the intellect thinks upon,
whether it is a reality or unreality, the same comes to take
place. The reflexion verily passes into reality. (The imagination
is the faculty representative of the phenomena of internal
and external worlds. It is both productive and reproductive.
<i>Sir Wm. Hamilton.</i> Here intellect means the Supreme Intellect,
the wisdom of God and his design in the works of creation.
All beings and things are manifestations of one Eternal and
original mind God).</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. Story of Karkatí the female fiend, and
her austerities for extirpation of Human Kind.</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> said:—Hear me relate to you, Ráma! an old
anecdote bearing upon this subject, and relating to a
difficult proposition adduced by the Rákshashí for solution.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. There lived on the north of Himálaya a heinous Rákshashí,
by name of Karkatí—a crooked crab; who was as dark as ink and
stalwart as a rock, with limbs as strong as could split the
sturdy oak.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. She was also known by the title of Visúchí or cholic pain,
by which she was ever afflicted, and which had reduced her
frame like that of the Vindhyá hill, which was cowered down
(by the curse of Agastya).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Her eye-balls were as blazing as fires; and her stature
reaching half way to the sky, was girt by a blue garment,
like the shade of night wrapping the atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. A white mantle formed the covering of her head, like the
fragment of a cloud; and the long erect hairs of her head,
stood like a sable cloud on her crest.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Her eyes flashed as lightnings, and her sharp hooked nails
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>glistened as sapphires; her legs were as long as <i>tamála</i> trees,
and her loud laughter was as a burst of frost.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. A string of dried bones decorated her body, like a wreath
of flowers; and the relics of dead bodies, adorned every part
of her body.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. She frolicked in the company of Vetálas, with human skulls
hanging down her ears as ear-rings; and stretched out her arms
aloft, as if she was going to pluck the sun from his sphere.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. Her huge body being in want of its necessary aliment, caused
her culinary fire to blaze like the submarine flame, which the
waters of the deep are unable to quench. (The latent heat
in water).</p>

<p class='c009'>10. Nothing could ever satiate the insatiable hunger, of this
big bellied monster; nor satisfy her lickerish tongue, which
was always stretched out like a flame of fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. She thought in herself saying:—Oh! if I could but once
go to the Jambudwípa—the land of Asia, I would devour all
its men in one swoop, and feast on them continually, like the
submarine fire upon the waters.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. As the clouds cool the burning sands by their rain, so will
I allay the burning fire of my hunger there. It is settled as
the best plan to support my life, at this critical moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. All men are well guarded by means of their <i>mantras</i>,
medicines, austerities, devotions and charities, from all evils
of the world; whence it is impossible for any body to destroy
the indestructible devotee. (My all destructive devotion will
destroy all; but render me indestructible).</p>

<p class='c009'>14. I will perform the most rigorous austerities, with an
unflinching heart and mind; because it is by intensity of
painstaking, that we may gain what is otherwise hard to be
had. (<i>Industria vincit omnia.</i>—Labour conquers all).</p>

<p class='c009'>15. Having thought so, she repaired to an inaccessible
mountain, for the purpose of destroying all animal beings.
(The Rákshasa cannibals are devourers of all flesh; and
are of the omnivorous kind).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>16. She climbed to the top of the mountain, by scrambling
over it with her hands and feet; and stood on it with her body
resembling a cloud, and her eye-balls flashing as lightnings.
(<i>i.e.</i> Her body and eyesight, were similar to the cloud and
lightning on the mountain top).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. Having got to the summit, she made her ablution and then
sat at her devotion; with her steadfast eyeballs resembling
the two orbs of the sun and moon, and fixed on one object.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. She passed there many a day and month, and saw the course
of many a season and year. She exposed her huge body to the
rigor of heat and cold, like the hill itself (on which she sat).</p>

<p class='c009'>19. She with her huge black body, remained unmoved as a
thick sable cloud, on the mountain top; and her jet black
hairs stood up as if to touch the sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. Seeing her body beaten by the blasts, and covered with
nothing but her ragged skin; and her hairs standing up to
their end, to be tossed to and fro by the raging winds;
while the twinklings of her eyelids, shed a whitish glare
on her sable frame, the god Brahmá made his appearance
before her.</p>

Argument. Brahmá’s boon to Visúchí,
and the <i>mantra</i> against her Power.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> resumed:—After the lapse of a thousand years,
  Brahmá appeared to her, in order to put an end to the ardour
  of her austerities, and crown her with success or the reward of
  her devotion. (Ardent devotion has the power of displacing even
  the gods from their heavenly seats).
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. She saluted him internally in her mind, and remained fixed
in her position; thinking about the boon she should beg of him,
for allaying her keen appetite.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. She soon recollected a certain request, which she should
prefer to her complying god; and it was to transform her soft
and flexible form to the shape of an inflexible iron-nail,
wherewith she could torment all living beings. (<i>i.e.</i> To make
her fleshy form as stiff as a poker, so as to be able to
pierce all others without being pierced herself).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. At Brahmá’s bidding, she bethought in herself: “I will become
as thin as a minute pin, in order to enter imperceptibly into
the hearts of animals, as the odor of flowers enters the nostrils.”</p>

<p class='c009'>5. “By this means will I suck the heart-blood of beings, to
my heart’s satisfaction; in this way will my hunger be satiated,
and the gratification of my appetite, will give the greatest
delight to my soul.”</p>

<p class='c009'>6. As she was thinking in this manner, the God discovered
her sinister motives, contrary to the character of a yogi;
and accosted her in a voice resembling the roaring of clouds.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>7. Brahmá said:—Daughter Karkatí, of the Rákshasa race, that
sittest here like a cloud on the inaccessible top of this
mountain; know that I am pleased with thy devotion, and bid
thee now to raise thyself, and receive the boon that thou
desirest of me.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Karkatí answered:—“O Lord of the past and future! If thou
art inclined to grant my request, then please to confer on
me the boon, of transforming my unironlike body to the form
of an iron needle.”</p>

<p class='c009'>9. Vasishtha said:—The God pronounced “Be it so,” and
joined, “thou wilt be as a pin, and shalt be called the
cholic pain, for thy giving pain to all bodies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>10. “Thou shalt be the cruel cause of acute pain and pang to
all living being; and particularly to the intemperate and
hard-working fools, and loose libertines, who are destined
to be thy devoted victims.”</p>

<p class='c009'>11. “Moreover shalt thou molest the dwellers of unhealthy
districts, and the practicers of malpractices; by entering
their hearts with thy infectious breath, and by disturbing
their sleep, and deranging the liver and other intestinal
parts of the body.”</p>

<p class='c009'>12. “Thou shalt be of the form of wind (in the bowels), and
cause bile and flatulence under the different names of colic
diseases, and attack the intemperate both among the wise and
unwise.”</p>

<p class='c009'>13. “The wise when attacked by thee, will be healed by
repeating this runic <i>mantra</i>, which I will here propound for
their benefit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>14. The mantra runs thus:—“There lives Karkatí, the
Rákshasí, in the north of the snowy mountain; her name is
Visúchiká, and it is for repelling her power that I repeat this
mantra; “Om, I bow to <i>hring, hrang</i> and <i>ring, rang</i>—the powers
of Vishnu, and invoke the Vaishnavi powers to remove, destroy,
root out, drive away this colic pain, far beyond the Himálayas,
and afar to the orb of the moon. Om, (amen) and <i>swáhá</i> (soho), be
it so.” Let these lines be held on the left arm as an amulet.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>15. “Then rub the painful part with the palm of that hand, and
think the colic Karkatí to be crushed under the mallet of this
amulet, and driven back beyond the hills with loud wailing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>16. “Let the patient think the medicinal moon to be seated
in his heart, and believe himself to be freed from death and
disease; and his faith will save his life and heal his pain.”</p>

<p class='c009'>17. “The attentive adept, who having purified himself with
sprinkling the water in his mouth, repeats this formula, he
succeeds in a short time to remove the colic pain altogether.”</p>

<p class='c009'>18. The lord of the three worlds then disappeared in the air,
after delivering this efficacious amulet to the <i>Siddhas</i>
attending upon him. He went to his splendid seat in heaven,
where he was received by the god Indra, who advanced to hail
him with his hosannas.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXX.<br> <br><span class="smcap">Conduct of Visúchí, or the Adventures of the Needle.</span><br></h2>
</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. The gradual leanness of <i>Súchí</i>,
  and her entrance in Human bodies.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> continued:—Now this Súchí who had been
  as tall as a mountain-peak, and a Rákshasí of the blackest
  kind, resembling a thick and dark cloud of the rainy season;
  began gradually to fade away, and grow leaner and leaner day
by day.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Her gigantic cloud-like form, was soon reduced to the
shape of the branch of a tree, which afterwards became of the
figure of a man, and then of the measure of a cubit only.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. It next became of the length of a span in its heighth, and
then of a finger’s length in all. Growing by degrees thinner
and thinner like a corn or grain, it became at last as lean
as a needle or pin.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. She was thus reduced to the thinness of a needle, fit only
to sew a silken robe; and became as lean as the filament of
the lotus flower by her own desire; which can change a hill to
a grain of sand. (This passage bears reference to the microcosm
of human soul).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. The unmetallic <i>Súchí</i>, was thus transformed to the form of
a black and slender iron needle; which containing all her limbs
and organs of her body in it, conducted her in the air and everywhere
as she liked. (Thus the gross human body being reduced to its
subtle <i>átiváhika</i> or spiritual form, it is possible for the Yogi
to traverse through the air, as we perceive in the course of our minds).</p>

<p class='c009'>6. She viewed her person as an iron pin, and having neither
any substance nor length or breadth of her body. (The false
idea of length and breadth of the soul is a fallacy of our
understanding; because the soul like a geometrical line,
has no dimension nor substance whatever in it).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>7. Her mind with its power of thought, appeared as bright
as a golden needle (pointing to the point); and as a streak
of the sapphire impregnated by solar ray.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Her rolling eye-balls, were as dark as the spots of black
clouds, moved to and fro by the winds; and her sparkling pupils
were gazing at the bright glory (of God); piercing through their
tenuous pores. (It is explained also as fixing the eye-sight to
some chink (as that of a wall or other), through which the light
of God enters the sensory of sight, and then penetrates into the
soul as in Yoga meditation).</p>

<p class='c009'>9. She had observed the vow of her taciturnity (mauna-vrata),
for reducing the plumpness of her person, and was gladdened in
her face, to become as lean as the filament of a feather. (The vow
of keeping silence is said to be of great good, by increasing the
power of thought; for he who speaks little thinks much, and who so
talks much, must talk in vain. It is the practice of <i>munis</i>
or saints to remain silent, whence the vow has its name).</p>

<p class='c009'>10. She beheld a light alighting on her, from the air at a distance;
and she was glad in her face to find her inward spirit, to be
sublimated as air. (The internal light and lightness of the
body are results of <i>yoga</i> practice).</p>

<p class='c009'>11. With her contracted eye brows, she beheld the rays of
light extending to her from afar; which caused the hairs on her
body, to stand up like those of babies at bathing.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. Her grand artery called Brahmanádí or <i>susumna</i>, was
raised about its cavity in the head called the <i>Brahma-randhra</i>;
in order to greet the holy light, as the filaments of the
lotus, rise to receive the solar light and heat.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. Having subdued the organs of her senses and their powers,
she remained as one without her organic frame, and identified
with her living soul; and resembled the intelligent principle
of the Bauddhas and Tárkikas, which is unseen by others. (<i>i.e.</i>
In her spiritual form only).</p>

<p class='c009'>14. Her minuteness seemed to have produced the <i>minutiae</i> of
minute philosophers, called the siddhárthas; and her silence
was like that of the wind confined in a cave. Her slender form
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>of the puny pin, resembled the breath of animal life, which is
imperceptible to the eye.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. The little that remained of her person, was as thin as
the last hope of man (which sustains his life). It was as the
pencil of the extinguished flame of a lamp; that has its heat
without the light.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. But alas! how pitiable was her folly, that she could not
understand at first, that she was wrong to choose for herself
the form of a slender pin, in order to gratify her insatiable
appetite.</p>

<p class='c009'>(This is a ridicule to Yogis and students, that emaciate themselves
with intense study and Yoga, only with a desire to pamper
their bodies afterwards, with luxuries and carnal enjoyments).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. Her object was to have her food, and not the contemptible
form of the pin; her heart desired one thing, and she found
herself in another form, that was of no use to her purpose.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. It was her silliness, that led her make the injudicious
choice of needleship for herself; and so it is with the short
witted, that they lack the sense of judging beforehand, about
their future good.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. An arduous attempt to accomplish the desired object, is
often attended by a different result; and even success on one hand,
becomes a failure on another; just as the mirror is soiled by the
breath, while it shows the face to the looker. (Disappointment
lurks in many a shape, and often stings us with success).</p>

<p class='c009'>20. How be it, the Rákshasí soon learnt to be content with
her needleship, after she had relinquished her gigantic form;
although she viewed her transformation as worse, than her
dissolution itself. (Utter annihilation is more desirable to
the Yogi than his metamorphosis to meaner forms).</p>

<p class='c009'>21. Lo! the contrariety in the desires of the infatuated, who
distaste in a trice, what they fondly wished at one time; as this
fiend was disgusted at her pinship in lieu of her monstrous figure.
(And so they wilfully shun the object of their former fondness,
as the suicides and dying people quit their fond bodies without
remorse).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>22. As one dish of food is easily replaced by another, suiting
the taste of the voluptuary; so this fiend did not hesitate
to shun her gigantic body, which she took to taste the heart
blood of animals in her pinnate form.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. Even death is delectable to the giddy headed, when they
are overfond of some thing else; as the minim of a meagre
needle was desirable to the monstrous fiend for the gratification
of her fiendish desire.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. Now this needle took the rarefied form of air, and moved
about as the colic wind (colica flatulenta), after all living
beings, in quest of her suction of animal gore.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. Its body was that of fiery heat, and its life the vital
breath of animals; its seat was in the sensitive heart, and
it was as swift as the particles of solar and lunar beams.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. It was as destructive as the blade of the deadly sword,
and as fleet as the effluvia flying in air. It penetrated
into the body in the form of the <i>minutiae</i> of odor.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. It was ever bent to do evil, like an evil spirit, as she
was now known by that name; and her sole object was to kill
the lives of others at her pleasure.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. Her body was afterwards divided into two halves; one
of which was as fine as a silken thread, and the other as
soft as a thread of cotton.</p>

<p class='c009'>29. Súchí ranged all about the ten sides of the world, in
these two forms of hers; and pierced and penetrated into the
hearts of living beings, with all her excruciating pains.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. It was for the accomplishment of all these purposes
of hers, whether they be great or little; that Karkatí forsook
her former big body, and took the form of the acute and small
needle. (Because humbleness and acuteness are the means of
success in every project).</p>

<p class='c009'>31. To men of little understanding, a slight business becomes
an arduous task; as the foolish fiend had recourse to her
austerities, in order to do the mean work of the needle.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. Again men however good and great, can hardly get rid of
their natural disposition; and it was for this reason that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>the great Rákshasí, performed her austere devotion, in
order to become a vile pin for molesting mankind.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. Now as Súchí was roving about in the sky, her aerial
form which was big with her heinous ambition, disappeared
in air like vapour, or as a thick cloud in autumn.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. Then entering in the body of some sensualist or weak
or too fat a person, this inward colic flatulence of Súchí,
assumed the shape of Visúchiká or cholera.</p>

<p class='c009'>35. Sometimes she enters in the body of some lean person,
as also in those of healthy and wise people; and appearing
at first as a colic pain, becomes a real cholera at last.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. She is often delighted, to take her seat in the hearts of
the ignorant; but is driven back afterwards by the good acts
and prayers, and <i>mantras</i> and medicines of the wise.</p>

<p class='c009'>37. In this manner she continued many years in her rambles;
her bipartite body kept sometimes flying up in the air, and
oftentimes creeping low on the ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>38. She lies concealed in the dust of the ground, and under the
fisted fingers of hands; she hides herself in the sun-beams,
in air and in the threads of cloths. (All this refers to the
pestilential air).</p>

<p class='c009'>39. She is hid in the intestines, entrails and genitals, and
resides in the bodies of pale and ash coloured persons; she
abides in the pores, lines and lineaments of the body; as also
in dry grass and in the dried beds of rivers (All these are
abodes of malaria).</p>

<p class='c009'>40. She has her seat among the indigent, and in the naked
and uncovered bodies of men; as also in those which are subject
to hard breathings. She dwells in places infested by flies and
of obstructed ventilation, as also in green verdures excepting
only of the mango and woodapple (bel) trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>41. She lurks in places scattered with bones and joints of
animal bodies, and such as are disturbed by violent winds, and
gusts of air, she lies in dirty places, and in cold and icy grounds
and likewise in polluted cloths and places polluted by them.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>42. She sits in holes and hollow places, withered trees, and
spots infested by crows, flies and peacocks. Also in places
of dry, humid and high winds, and in benumbed fingers and toes.</p>

<p class='c009'>43. As also in cloudy regions, in cavernous districts of the
form of rotten bodies; in regions of melting and driving snows,
and in marshy grounds abounding in ant hills and hills of málúra
trees. (<i>Málúra</i> is <i>Kapitha</i> or <i>kath-bel</i>, which is deemed unwholesome).</p>

<p class='c009'>44. She exhibits herself in the mirage of desert sand, and
in wildernesses abounding with ravenous beasts and snakes.
Sometimes she is seen in lands infested by venomous reptiles,
and disgusting leeches and worms.</p>

<p class='c009'>45. She frequents the stagnate pools, soiled by dry leaves and
those chewed by the Pisáchas; and haunts the hovels beside the
cross ways, where passengers halt and take shelter from cold.</p>

<p class='c009'>46. She rambles in all places, ever where the leeches suck the
blood of men, and vile people tear them with their nails and hold
them in their fists for feeding upon them. (Here is a relation
between the blood sucking Súchí or Needle and the leeches).</p>

<p class='c009'>47. In this manner she passes in all places, that we view in
the landscape of cities in drawings; until she is tired with
her long journey through them.</p>

<p class='c009'>48. She then stops in her course like a tired bullock, whose
body is heated by travelling through towns, with loads of
cotton and utensils on their backs.</p>

<p class='c009'>49. She afterwards lays her down to rest in some hidden place,
like a needle tired with continued sewing; and there drops down
like it, from its bridling thread in the hand of the sewer.</p>

<p class='c009'>50. The hard needle held in the hand of the sewer, never
hurts his finger; because a servant however sharp he may be,
is never faithless or is injurious to his master.</p>

<p class='c009'>51. The iron needle growing old in its business of stitching,
was at last lost by itself; like the rotten plank of a boat,
bearing the burthensome ballast of stones in it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>52. It wandered about on all sides of its own accord, and was
driven to and fro like chaff by the driving winds, according to
the course of nature (with all things).</p>

<p class='c009'>53. Being taken up by some one, it is fed with the fag end
of a thread put into its mouth, as the malady of cholera is
caught by those human parasites, who glut themselves with
food supplied by the sap of another.</p>

<p class='c009'>54. The malady of colic, like the needle, is ever fond of feeding
on the pith of others with its open mouth; and continually finds
the thread-like heartstring of some body put into its hole.</p>

<p class='c009'>55. Thus the strong bodies of greedy and heinous beings, are
nourished by the sap of the weak and innocent, as the colic
disease preys on the lean bodies of the poor; and the sharp
needle is supported by the thin thread of the needy (who
cannot afford to buy new suits).</p>

<p class='c009'>56. Though the heart of Súchí like the hole of the needle, was
to receive the thread-like sap of the patient’s heart; yet her
power to pierce it, was like that of the sewing needle, which
is as potent as the piercing sun-beams, to penetrate into the
toughest substances.</p>

<p class='c009'>57. At last Súchí came to find on a sudden, the fault of her
wrong choice of the puny body (of the needle); which was to be
filled with her scanty fare of a bit of thread, and then she
began to repent for her folly.</p>

<p class='c009'>58. She continued however with all her might, to trudge on in
her wonted course, of pricking and piercing the bodies of others;
and notwithstanding her great regret, she could not avoid the
cruelty of her nature.</p>

<p class='c009'>59. The sewing man cuts and sews the cloth; agreeably to his
own liking; but the weaver of destiny weaves the long loom of
lengthened desires in all bodies, and hides their reason under
the garb of her own making.</p>

<p class='c009'>60. The colic Súchí went on like the sewing needle, in her
business of piercing the hearts of people by hiding her head;
as it is the practice of robbers to carry on their rogueries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>by covering their faces. (All the three are sly boots, and
carry on their trades under the seal of secrecy).</p>

<p class='c009'>61. She like the needle with the sewing thread behind it,
raises her head to make and look at the loop-hole, that she
should penetrate in the manner of burglars, making and
marking the holes in the wall for their entry.</p>

<p class='c009'>62. She entered alike in the bodies of the weak and strong,
like the needle stitching cloths of all textures (whether
silken, linen or fibrous); as it is the custom of the wicked
to spare neither the just nor unjust (from their calumny and
villainy).</p>

<p class='c009'>63. The colic pain like the piercing needle, being pressed
under the fingers, lets off its griping, like the thread of the
needle in its act of sewing. (So the wicked when caught in the
act, let out and give up their wickedness).</p>

<p class='c009'>64. The acute and unfeeling colic, being as ignorant as the
stiff and heartless needle, of the softness or dryness of the
object; pierces the hardiest breast, without deriving any
sweetness from it. (So the unfeeling ruffians molest the
moneyless, to no benefit to themselves).</p>

<p class='c009'>65. The needle is compared with a rich widow, being both
equally stern and full of remorse; both equally veiled and
speechless, and with their eye of the needle, are empty in
their joyless hearts.</p>

<p class='c009'>66. The needle hurts no body (but rather does good in clothing
mankind, by mending their tattered habits); and yet she is
dragged by the thread, which is no other than the thread of
her fate (woven by the fatal sisters for her drudgery).</p>

<p class='c009'>67. Slipt from the finger of her master, the needle sleeps in
peace after her trudging, in company with her fellows of dirt
and dregs; for who is there that does not deem himself blest,
in the company of his equals, when he is out of employ?</p>

<p class='c009'>68. The herd of common people, is ever fond of mixing with
the ignorant rabble in their modes of life; because there is
no body that can avoid the company of his equals. (Kind flies
with its own kind; or, Birds of one feather fly together).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>69. The lost needle when found by a blacksmith and heated
in the hearth, flies to heaven by the breath of the bellows,
after which it disappears in the air. (So the society of
the good elevates one to heaven, which leads at last to
his final liberation).</p>

<p class='c009'>70. In this manner the current of vital airs, conducts the
breath of life in to the heart; which becomes the living spirit,
by force of the acts of its prior states of existence.</p>

<p class='c009'>71. The vital airs being vitiated, in the body, cause the colic
pains known by different names; such as flatulence, bile and
the like.</p>

<p class='c009'>72. The colic caused by vitiation of the Vyána air, produces
many diseases, and affects all the members of the body with
a watery fluid. When it comes by breathing of the lungs, it
causes the <i>Váya súla</i> or pulmonary colic of lungs, and
is attended by disfigurement of the body, and insanity or
hysteria known as the hysteric colic.</p>

<p class='c009'>73. Sometimes it comes from the hands of sheepkeepers, and
by the smell of the sheep’s wool in blankets; and at others
it seizes the fingers of children, and causes them to tear
their bed cloths therewith.</p>

<p class='c009'>74. When it enters the body by the foot, it continues in
sucking the blood; and with all its voracity, becomes
satisfied with very little food.</p>

<p class='c009'>75. It lies in the glandular vessel of the faeces, with its mouth
placed downward; and takes at pleasure any form, it likes to assume
as its prerogative.</p>

<p class='c009'>76. It is the nature of the malicious, to show the pervertedness
of their hearts by doing injury to others; as it is characteristic
of the base people to raise a row for their pleasure, and not for
any gain or good to themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>77. The miserly think much of their gain of even a single cowry:
so deeprooted is the avaricious selfishness of human nature.
(All little gain is no gain, compared with the wants of men).</p>

<p class='c009'>78. It was but for a particle of blood, or as much as could be
picked out by the point of a pin, that the colic Súchí was bent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>on the destruction of men: so the wise are fools in their own
interests (and so do cut-throats kill others for a single groat).</p>

<p class='c009'>79. How great is my master-stroke, says the needle, that
from stitching the shreds of cloth, have come to the pitch
of piercing the hearts of men; so be it and I am happy at
my success.</p>

<p class='c009'>80. As the rust of the lazy needle passes off in sewing, without
being rubbed with dust; so must it take the rust, unless it is
put in the action of piercing the patient and passive shreds.
(The rolling stone gathers no moss).</p>

<p class='c009'>81. The unseen and airy darts of fate, are as fatal as the acts
of the cruel Vísúchi; though both of them have their respite at
short intervals of their massacres.</p>

<p class='c009'>82. The needle is at rest after its act of sewing is done;
but the wicked are not satisfied, even after their acts of
slaughter are over.</p>

<p class='c009'>83. It dives in the dirt and rises in the air, it flies with
the wind and lies down wherever it falls; it sleeps in the dust
and hides itself at home and in the inside, and under the cloths
and leaves. It dwells in the hand and ear-holes, in lotuses and
heaps of woolen stuffs. It is lost in the holes of houses, in
clefts of wood and underneath the ground. (Compare the adventures
of a pin in Gay’s Fables).</p>

<p class='c009'>84. Válmíki added:—As the sage was speaking in this manner,
the sun went down in the west, and the day departed to its
evening service. The assembly broke after mutual salutations,
to perform their sacred ablution; and joined again on the
next morning, with the rising beams of the sun to the royal
palace.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> continued:—After the carnivorous fiend—Karkatí,
had feasted for a long period on the flesh and blood of
human kind; she found her insatiable voracity to know
no bounds, and never to be satisfied with anything.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. She used to be satisfied erewhile, with a drop of blood in
her form of the needle; and she now became sorry, at the loss of
the insatiable thirst and appetite of her former state.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. She thought in herself, O pity it is! that I came to be a
vile needle; with so weak and slender a body, that I can take
nothing for my food.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. How foolish I have been to forego my former gigantic
form, and change my dark cloudy figure for something as the
dry leaf of a forest tree.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. O wretch that I am, to have foregone my dainty food of
flesh flavoured with fat. (The Ráskshasa cannibals are raw
flesh-eaters and feeders on the fat of animals).</p>

<p class='c009'>6. I am doomed to dive in dirt, and drop down on the ground;
to be trodden and trampled over under the feet of people, and
soiled and sullied in the filth.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. O me miserable, helpless and hopeless thing, and without
any support or status of mine; from one woe I fall to another,
and one danger is succeeded by another unto me!</p>

<p class='c009'>8. I have no mistress nor maidservant, nor my father nor
mother; I have got no son nor brother, nor any one to serve
or befriend me.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. I have no body nor abode, nor any refuge nor asylum
anywhere; nor have I a fixed dwelling in any spot, but am
driven about, like the fallen leaves of forest trees by
the driving winds.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>10. I am subject to all accidents, and exposed to every kind
of calamity; I wish for my extinction, but it wishes not to
approach unto me. (Death flies from the destitute).</p>

<p class='c009'>11. What else have I done to have given away my own big body,
in the foolishness of my heart; than parted like a madman,
with a precious jewel for a paltry piece of glass.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. One calamity is enough to turn the brain out of order;
but what will be my case when it is followed by other
calamities in endless succession.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. I am hung up (with the cloth) to be suffocated by the
smoke, and dropped down in the streets to be trodden under foot;
I am cast away with the dirt, and hid under the grass to my
great distress.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. I serve at another’s will, and am guided by my guide;
I am stark naked while I sew for others, and am ever a
dependant on another’s guidance.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. Long do I drudge and trudge for a paltry gain, and
stitching alone is all the work that I have to perform for
life. O unlucky that I am, that my ill luck even is so very
luckless.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. I see the demon of despair rising before me, upon my
penitence of this day; and threatening to make an end of
this body, of which I have made an offering to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. What better fate can await on me, after my loss of so big
and bulky a body by my foolishness; than to be annihilated
into nothing, rather than be a thing which is good for
nothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. What man will pick me up, who am as lean as a mollusk
(or thread worm); from the heap of ashes, under which I lie
buried by the wayside.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. No keensighted man will take into his consideration a
wretched and a forlorn being; as nobody living on a high hill,
ever stoops to take notice of the grass growing on the ground
below.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. I cannot expect to raise myself higher, while I am lying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>in the sea of ignorance; what blind man can perceive the
glorious sun-light, who is guided by the flash of fireflies?</p>

<p class='c009'>21. I know not therefore how long I shall have to labour
under my difficulties, when I find myself already drowned
in a sea of misery.</p>

<p class='c009'>22. When shall I be restored again to the form of the daughter
of Anjanágiri mountain; and will stand as a pillar over the
ruins of the nether and upper worlds?</p>

<p class='c009'>23. When shall I have my arms reaching to the clouds, and
my eyes flashing as lightning; my garb becoming as white
as snow, and my hairs touching the sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. My big belly resembling a huge cloud, and my long
breasts hanging below as pillows; shaking with the motion
of my body, in its dancing like the pinions of a peacock.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. The ash-white light emitted by my laughter, cast the
light of the sun into the shade; and my former high stature,
threatened to devour the terrible god of death.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. My hollow sockets deep as the holes of mortars, flashed
erewhile with living fire; like the rays of the sun; and my
large legs moved as two monumental pillars in my rambling.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. When shall I have my big belly, with its large cavity
like a pot-belly; and when shall I have again my soft black
nails, resembling the dark and humid clouds of autumn.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. When will those tender smiles return to me, whereby I
moved the great Rákshasas to my favour; and when shall I
dance in my giddy circles, at the music of the tabor amidst
the forests.</p>

<p class='c009'>29. When will that big belly of mine, be filled with potfuls
of fattened liquor; and be fed with heaps of the flesh and
bones of dead bodies.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. When shall I get me drunk, with drinking the blood of
human gores; and become merry and giddy, until I fall fast
asleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. It was I who destroyed my former brilliant body, by my
bad choice of austerities, and accepted this petty needlish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>form, like one taking the sulphate of gold, instead of that
precious metal.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. Ah! where is that huge body which filled all sides, and
shone as the sable hill of Anjanágiri; and what is this puny
and pinny form of the shape of a spider’s leg, and as thin
and lean as a tender blade of grass.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. The ignorant are found to throw away a golden jewel,
as useless on the ground as a piece of glass; and so have I
cast aside my shining body, for a bit of this blackest needle.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. O great Vindhyá with thy hollow and snow covered
caves! why dost thou not destroy thy dull elephants by thy
native lions? It is I that am as silly as an elephant—<i>gaja
múrkha</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>35. O my arms! which used to break down mountain peaks,
why do ye fail to pluck the butter-like moon with thy
moony nails?</p>

<p class='c009'>36. O my breast! which was as fair as the side of the
snowy mountain, even without my glassy ornaments; why dost
thou not show thy hairs, which were as large as leeches
that feed on lion’s flesh?</p>

<p class='c009'>37. O my eyes! that used to dispel the darkness of the
darkest night, and kindle the dry fuel with your glaring fire;
why do ye cease to lighten the air with your effulgence?</p>

<p class='c009'>38. O my shoulder blades! are ye broken down and levelled
with the earth? or are ye crushed and smashed or mouldered
and worn out by age?</p>

<p class='c009'>39. O my moonbright face! why dost thou not shine over me
with thy bright beams; resembling the everlasting light of
the orb of the moon, now at an end for ever?</p>

<p class='c009'>40. O my hands! where is your strength fled today? See
ye not, how I am transformed to an ignoble needle, that
is moved about by the touch of the foot of a fly?</p>

<p class='c009'>41. Alas! the cavity of my navel, which was as deep as a
well, and beset by hairs resembling rows of beautiful plants
about it; and my protuberant posteriors, which likened to the
bottom of the Vindhyá hills.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>42. Where is that towering stature reaching to the sky, and
what is this new earned contemptible form of the needle; where
is that mouth, hollow as the vault of the sky, and what is this
hole of the needle? Where is that heap of my flesh meat, and
what is this drop of watery food? Ah! how lean have I grown,
but who is to be blamed for an act of my own doing?</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXXII.<br> <br><span class="smcap">Fervour of Súchí’s Devotion.</span><br></h2>
</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. Ardour of Súchí’s austerities
and Indra’s Inquiry of it.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> continued:—Afterwards Súchí became silent
and motionless, and thought of resuming her austerities
for the sake of regaining her long lost body.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. With this intention she returned to the Himálayas; and
there abstaining from her desire of human gore, she sat
reiterating her castigations.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. She saw in her mind her form of the needle,
entering into her heart with her breathings.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Thus meditating on her mental form of the needle, she
was wafted by her vital breath to the top of the hill, and
alighted on it like a vulture from high.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. There she remained alone and apart from all living beings,
and sat amidst burning fires, with her form of an ash-coloured
stone (<i>i.e.</i> besmeared by ashes like a <i>yogi</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>6. She sat there as a sprout of grass, springing in that
dry and grassless spot; but soon faded away, to a blade
of withered hay in the sandy desert.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. She remained standing on tip-toe of her only one foot, and
continued in the castigation of her own self. (Standing of the
one legged needle, represented the posture of devotees standing
on one leg).</p>

<p class='c009'>8. She lightly touched the ground with her tiptoe stature,
and avoiding all sidelong looks, gazed on the upper sky
with her upraised face and uplifted eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. The acute point of the black iron needle, firmly preserved
its standing posture by penetrating the ground; while it fed
itself upon the air, which it inhaled by its uplifted mouth.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. The scarcity of food in the forest, made it look up as in
quest of some prey coming from a distance; while its lower
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>part shaking with the wind, enticed the unwary to approach
towards it.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. The ray of light issuing as a pencil from the needle
hole, became like its attendant guard on the hinder part.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. As men are kindly disposed towards the mean, that are
favourites to them; so was the needle attached to the pencil
of ray, that became its constant attendant.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. The needle had another constant companion, of its devotion
in its own shadow; but the blackness of its person, made it
always to remain behind the back. (The shadow of a thing
ever remains behind it).</p>

<p class='c009'>14. Thus the shadowy needle and pencil of ray, having firmly
adhered themselves to the iron needle; these three have always
become intimate friends, like all good people mutually assisting
one another.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. The trees and plants of the mountain forest, felt compassion
for Súchí on seeing her in this plight; for who is there, that
bears no sympathy for the pious devotee, or her penances and
austerities?</p>

<p class='c009'>16. The needle that was thus stuck fast to the ground by its
foot, and had sprung up like some faculty of the mind; was
fed with the fragrance of the fruitage, blown and borne by
the breeze to its uplifted mouth.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. The woodland gods and demigods, continued to fill its
mouth with the dust; of blown and unblown flowers in the woods.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. But it did not swallow the powdered dust of meat;
which the god Indra had caused to be thrown into its mouth,
for the purpose of frustrating the efficacy of its devotion.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. Its fixity of purpose, did not permit it to swallow the
delicious powder; because a person however mean he may be,
is sure of success by his firmness of mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. The god of winds, with his power of uprooting the
mountains; was astonished to find the needle, averse to
swallow the food, ministered to it in the form of the
<a id="pollen"></a>pollen of &lt;flowers&gt;.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>21. The resolute devotee is never to be shaken from his
purpose, though he is plunged in the mud or drowned in water,
or scattered by the winds and thrown into the burning fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>22. Or when he is shattered by showers of hailstones, or
struck by the lightning or battered by rain drops, and
intimidated by thunder claps.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. The resolute mind is not changed in a thousand years,
and the feet of the firm, like those of the drowsy and
dead drunk, never move from their place.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. The holy hermit who is devoted to his purpose, loses
in time the motion of his external organs; but obtains by
the exercise of his reason, the light of true knowledge in
his soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. Thus did Súchí gain the light of knowledge, and become
a seer of the past and future. She became cleansed of the
dross of her sins, and her Visúchí or impurity was turned
to Súchí or purity.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. She came to know the truly knowable, in her own
understanding; and she felt true bliss in her soul,
after the removal of her sins by devotion.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. She continued for many thousand years in her austere
devotion, to the great astonishment of seven times seven worlds,
that got affrighted at her austerities. (The cause of their fright
was, lest she should take possession of their happy states, by
the merit of her devotion).</p>

<p class='c009'>28. The great mountain was set in a blaze, by the fervour of
her devotion; and that flame spread to all the worlds, like
the blaze of a portentous meteor.</p>

<p class='c009'>29. This made Indra the god of heaven, to ask Nárada respecting
the cause of this intense devotion; saying “Who is it that
engrosses to her the fruition of worlds, by her austere
devotion”? To whom Nárada thus replied:</p>

<p class='c009'>30. “It is Súchí, who by her continued devotion of thousands
of years, has attained her highest state of enlightenment;
and it is that light that now enflames all the worlds.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>31. It is Súchí’s devotion, O lord of gods, that makes the
Nágás to sigh and the hills to tremble. It causes the celestials
to fall down, and the sea to overflow on earth. It dries up all
things, and casts to shade the bright orb of the sun itself.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXXIII.<br> <br><span class="smcap">Nárada’s Relation of Súchí’s Devotion.</span><br></h2>
</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. Description of Súchí’s <i>austerities</i>,
and Indra’s Inquiry about them.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> related:—Indra having learnt about the austere
devotion of Karkatí, had the curiosity to know more of her
through Nárada, whom he asked about the matter.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Indra said:—I know Súchí to have acquired her fiendish
practice (of blood sucking), by means of her devotion; but
who is this apish Karkatí that is so greedy of her gain
(of flesh and bones).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Nárada replied:—It is Karkatí the malevolent fiend, that
became <i>Jíva Súchí</i> or colic pain of the living, and assumed
the shape of an iron needle as its support or fulcrum.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Having afterwards forsaken that prop, it entered into the
human body as its landing place; and then it flew up to the
heart on the vehicle of vital breath, and is seated in the car
of the current air in atmosphere. (The resting place <i>locus
standi, point d’appui or powsto</i> of the diseases of life).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. This colic of life—<i>Jíva Súchí</i>, having entered into the
bodies of vicious lives, passes through the canals of their
entrails and the pores of their flesh, fat and blood, and then
nestles as a bird in the interior part.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. It enters the intestines with the breath of the air, and
there settles in the form of flatulent colic; afterwards
being seated at the end of the <i>nyagrodha</i> artery, it forms
the plethoric colic with fulness of blood and inflammation.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. It also enters the body through other parts and organs, and
receives different names according to its situation; and then
feeds itself upon their flesh and marrow (as the best food for
living beings).</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Fastened to the knots of wreathed flowers and stuck to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>leafy garlands, decorating the breasts and cheeks of fond damsels,
she steeps enraptured with them, on the bosoms of their loving
spouses. (<i>i.e.</i> The menial needle is blessed in the company of
her mistress).</p>

<p class='c009'>9. She flies to the bodies of birds in wood-land retreats,
which are free from worldly sorrow and strife; and flutters
on the tops of flowers of the Kalpa arbours of Paradise, or
rolls on beds of lotuses in the lakes.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. She flies over the high hills of the gods, in the forms
of fluttering bees; and sips the honey drops, perfumed with
the fragrance of the pollen of <i>mandara</i> flowers.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. She devours in the form of vultures, the entrails of the
dead bodies of warriors, through the notches made in them, by
blades of swords in warfare.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. She flies up and down in the pellucid and glassy paths of
the firmament, and pierces through all the pores and arteries
or inlets into the human body; as the inflated winds pass in
every creek and corner on all sides.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. As the universal vital air (prána-váyu), runs in the heart
of every living being, in the form of the pulsation of air;
so does Súchí oscillate in every body, as it were her own
habitation.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. As the intellectual powers are lodged in every person, in the
manner of blazing lamps in them; so does she reside and blaze
as the mistress of every body; answering her dwelling house.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. She sparkles as the vital spark in the particles of blood,
and flows as fluidity in liquid bodies; she rolls and trolls in
the bowels of living beings, as whirl pools whirl about in the
bosom of the sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. She rests in the milk white mass of flesh, as Vishnu
reclines on his bed of the serpent Vásuki; she tastes the
flavour of the blood of all hearts, as the goddess (Kálí)
drinks the liquor of her goblet of wine.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. She sucks the circulating red hot blood of hearts, as
the winds absorb the internal and vivifying juice, from the
hearts of plants and trees.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>18. Now this living Súchí, intending to become a devotee,
remains as motionless as an immovable substance, and as
fixed and steady in her mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. The iron-hearted needle, being now rarefied as the
invisible air, is traversing to all sides, on the swift
wings of winds resembling its riding horses.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. It goes on feeding on the flesh and drinking the blood
of all living beings; and carrying on its various acts of
giving and receiving, and dancing and singing all along.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. Though the incorporeal <i>Súchí</i> has become aeriform
and invisible as vacuum, yet there is nothing which she is
unable to accomplish by the powers of her mind, outstripping
the swiftness of the winds.</p>

<p class='c009'>22. But though she runs mad with her meat, and turns
about giddy with her drink; yet she is curbed by fate,
like an elephant in chains from running at random.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. The living body like a running stream, moves apace with
billows in its course; and the painful and destructive
diseases under which it labours, are as greedy sharks
lying hid underneath.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. This frail body like the formless Súchí, being disabled
by infirmity to gorge its fleshy food, begins to lament its
fate, like old and sickly rich folks, for their want of hunger
and appetite.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. The body with its members, moves about like the beasts of the
forest (for their prey); and it plays its parts like an actress
on the stage, with goodly apparel and ornaments on her person.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. The body is moved to and fro by its internal and external
winds, and its natural weakness (immobility), is always in need
of being moved by the vital airs, as the immovable fragrance
requires to be wafted by the breeze.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. Men in vain rely in mantras and medicines, in austerities
and charities, and in the adoration of idols for relief; while
their bodies are subject to diseases like the sea to its surges.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. The unseen force of mobility, is soon lost in the solid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>body, as the light of the lamp is lost in darkness. So the
living Súchí came to be lost in the iron needle, in which she
had her rest. (<i>i.e.</i> The living body is lost and transformed
to a spirit, wherein it finds its rest after death).</p>

<p class='c009'>29. Every one aspires to a state according to his natural
propensity; as the inclination of the Rákshasi led her to
choose the needleship upon herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. A man being tired by travelling far and wide, returns at
last to take his rest at home; so the big and living Súchí
turned to the form of the <i>thin</i> iron Súchí to execute her
repose; but like ignorant people, who prefer the grosser
pleasure of the body to the nicer delights of the soul;
she still panted for her grosser enjoyments, that were
now lost to her.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. With the intention of satisfying her thirst, she travelled
to all parts and quarters (in her form of the poor needle); but
derived more of the mental pleasure of experience, than the
satisfaction of her corporeal appetites.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. When the container is in existence, it is possible to fill
it with its contents and not otherwise; so one having his body,
can seek and get every pleasurable object to give it delight.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. Remembering now the past enjoyments of her former
body, she became sorrowful in her mind, that was so highly
pleased and satisfied with filling its belly before.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. She was then resolved to betake herself to austere
devotion, for the purpose of recovering her former body;
and with this object in view, she chose for herself the
proper situation for her castigations.</p>

<p class='c009'>35. The living soul of Súchí, thought of entering into the
heart of a young vulture flying in the air; and thus soared
to it and rested herself in the air like that bird, by the
help of her vital breath. (<i>i.e.</i> The greedy spirit was turned
to the form of a hungry vulture to shriek and seek for carrion).</p>

<p class='c009'>36. The vulture being thus filled with the malevolent spirit
of the colic Súchí in itself, began to think of executing
the purposes that Súchí had in her mind.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>37. Thus the vulture bearing the insatiate Súchí within its
body, flew to its intended spot on the mountain. It was driven
there like a cloud by the wind, and it was in this place that
Súchí was to be released from her needleship.</p>

<p class='c009'>38. It sat there on a spot of the solitary forest in its state
of asceticism, seeming to be freed from all desires of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>39. It stood there on one of its legs, supported on the tip of
its toe and appeared as the statue of some deity, consecrated
on the top of the mountain by some one in the form of Garuda.</p>

<p class='c009'>40. There standing on one leg, supported on an atom of
dust; she remained as the mountain peacock, that stands
on one leg with the head raised to the sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>41. The bird seeing the living Súchí coming out of his
body, and standing on the mountain as a statue, fled away
and disappeared from that place.</p>

<p class='c009'>42. Súchí issued from the body of the bird, in the manner of the
spirit coming out of it, and the intellect aspiring to higher
regions; and as the particles of fragrance fly upon the wings
of winds, in order to meet the breath of the nostrils to be
borne into the nose.</p>

<p class='c009'>43. The vulture fled to his own place after leaving Súchí
at that place, like a porter disburthening himself of his
load; and found himself relieved of his lickerish diseases
on his return.</p>

<p class='c009'>44. Now the iron Súchí, being seated in her devotion, in
the form of the living Súchí; appeared as graceful as a
right man engaged in the performance of his proper duty.</p>

<p class='c009'>45. And as the formless spirit is unable to do anything,
without a formal support or instrument; so the living Súchí
supported herself on the tip of her toe, for performance of
her devotion.</p>

<p class='c009'>46. The living Súchí has sheathed the iron needle (in her
heart), as an evil spirit (Písáchí) enwraps a Sinsapá tree;
and as the winds enfold the particles of odor, which they
bear away in their bosom.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>47. Thenceforwards, O Indra! has she betaken herself
to her protracted devotion, and passed many years in the
solitary wilderness in her steady position and posture of body.</p>

<p class='c009'>48. It now behoves you, O Indra! that art skilled in stratagems,
to devise some plan, in order to delude her from her object, or
else her devotion will destroy the people, you have so long
preserved.</p>

<p class='c009'>49. Vasishtha said:—Indra having heard these words of
Nárada, sent Maruta (Eolus) the god of winds to her
search, in all quarters of the globe.</p>

<p class='c009'>50. The god Maruta then proceeded in quest of her, in his
spiritual form of intelligence; and having traversed the etherial
regions, alighted upon the nether world. The winds and all
other elemental and physical powers, are believed to be endued
with intelligence also; and not as mere brute forces, on account
of the regular discharge of their proper functions, which they
could never do without intelligence.</p>

<p class='c009'>(Hence the imagination and adoration of the Marutgana in
the elemental worship of the Veda).</p>

<p class='c009'>51. He beheld everything instantly at a glance of his intelligence;
which perceived all things at one view; as the sight of the
Supreme Spirit sees through all bodies without exception or
hindrance. (<i>i.e.</i> The sight of the spirit like its breath,
sees through and supports all things).</p>

<p class='c009'>52. His sight stretched to the Lokáloka mountain in the polar
circle, far beyond the seven seas of the earth, where there
is a large tract of land abounding with gems. (It is doubtful
whether the polar mountain or sea abounds with gems).</p>

<p class='c009'>53. He viewed the circle of the Pushkara continent, surrounded
by a sea of sweet water; and containing mountains with their
dales and valleys.</p>

<p class='c009'>54. He next saw the Gomeda islands, surrounded by the sea
of liquor with its marine animals; and the land abounding
with cities and towns.</p>

<p class='c009'>55. He beheld also the fertile and peaceful continent of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Kraunchadwípa, bounded by the sweet Saccharine sea, and
beset by a range of mountains.</p>

<p class='c009'>56. Further on was the Swetadvípa (Albion island), with its
subsidiary isles surrounded by the Milky (Atlantic) ocean,
and having the temple of Vishnu in the midst of it (meaning
perhaps the ancient Kelts to be colony of the Hindus).</p>

<p class='c009'>57. After that appeared the sea of butter, surrounding the
Kushadwípa island; and having chains of mountains and cities
with buildings in them. (Butter milk &amp;c., are fictitious names
and not this really).</p>

<p class='c009'>58. Then came the Sákadwípa in view amidst the ocean of
curds, containing many countries and many large and populous
cities in them. (The <i>sákadwípa</i> is said to be Scythia or the
land of the saccae or sakas).</p>

<p class='c009'>59. Last appeared the Jambudwípa girt by the sea of salt,
having the Meru and other boundary mountains, and many
countries in it. (This is Asia stretching to the polar
mountains on the north and south).</p>

<p class='c009'>60. Thus the intelligence of air (Marut), having alighted on
earth upon the wings of winds, spread himself afterwards to
its utmost ends with rapidity (or spread himself rapidly to
its utmost limits afterwards).</p>

<p class='c009'>61. The god of air then directed his course to Jambudwípa
(Asia), and having arrived there, he made his way to the
summit of the snowy mountain. (Himálaya, where Súchí was
performing her devotion).</p>

<p class='c009'>62. He saw a great desert on the highest top of the summit,
which was as extensive as the expanse of the sky, and devoid
both of living creatures and the vestiges of animal bodies. (<i>i.e.</i>
There were neither any living being not fossil remains to be
found on the mountain peak).</p>

<p class='c009'>63. It was unproductive of greens or grass owing to its
nighness to the sun; and was covered over with dust, like
that composing this earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>64. There spread a wide ocean of the mirage to excite the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>thirst, like the lucid waters of a river; and allure the longings
of men by its various hues, resembling the variegated colours
of rain-bow.</p>

<p class='c009'>65. Its wide expanse reaching almost to infinity, was unmeasurable
even by the regents of the quarters of heaven, and
the gusts of wind, blowing upon it, served only to cover it with
a canopy of dust.</p>

<p class='c009'>66. It resembled a wanton woman, besmeared with red
powder as the sunbeams, and sandal paste like the moonbeams;
and attentive to the whistlings of the breeze. (Thinking them
to be hissings of men).</p>

<p class='c009'>67. The god of the winds having travelled all over the seven
continents and their seas, and being tired with his long journey
on the surface of the earth; rested his gigantic body which fills
the infinite space in all directions, on the top of that mountain;
like a butterfly resting on the twig of a tree, after its wearied
flight in the air.</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. Return of the god of winds to the Indra, and his
narration of the Devotion of Súchí and her desired Boon.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> god of the winds beheld Súchí standing erect, like a
crest on the summit of the mountain, amidst that vast tract
of the desert all around.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. She stood upon one leg fixed in her meditation and roasted
by the burning sun over her head; she was dried up to a skeleton
by her continued fasting, and her belly was contracted to the
shrunken skin. (<i>i.e.</i> She was threadbare as skin in all her
body and belly).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Now and then, she inhaled the hot air with her open mouth,
and then breathed it out, as her heart could not contain the
repeated influx of air. (Respiration of air is practised by
Yogis, to sustain their lives therewith for want of solid food).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. She was withered under the scorching sunbeams, and
battered in her frame by the hotter winds of the desert;
yet she moved not from her stand-point, as she was
relieved every night by the cold bath of moonbeams.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. She was content with covering her head under the particles
of dust, and did not like to change her state for a better
fortune. (<i>i.e.</i> She preferred her poverty to high dignity).</p>

<p class='c009'>6. She gave up the possession of her forest to other living
beings, and lived apart from all in the form of a crest of
hair. Her breathings being withdrawn to the cranium, appeared
out of it as a tuft of hairs or bushes clapped on her head.
(Air confined in the cranium, is said to keep the body alive
for ages).</p>

<p class='c009'>7. The god of air was astonished to see Súchí in this state;
he bowed down to her and was struck with terror as he beheld
her more earnestly. (The countenance of the holy is awful to
the sight of the unholy).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>8. He was so overawed by the blaze of her person, that he
durst not ask her anything, such as:—“O saintly Súchí! why
dost thou undertake thyself to these austerities”?</p>

<p class='c009'>9. He only exclaimed, O holy Súchí, how wondrous is this
sight of thy devotion! Impressed with veneration for her
holiness, the god made his departure to heaven whence he came.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. He passed the region of the clouds, and reached the sphere
of the still air (sthíra váyu); and then leaving the realm of
the Siddhas behind him, he arrived to the path of the sun—the
ecliptic.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. Then rising higher in his airy car, he got into the city
of Indra, where he was cordially embraced by the lord of gods,
for the merit of his sight of Súchí. (Visit to sacred persons
and holy shrines, is believed to impart a share of holiness
to the visitant).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. Being asked what he saw, he related all that he had seen,
before the assembled gods in the synod of Sakra or Indra.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. Pavana said:—There is the King of mountains the high
Himalaya, situate in the midst of Jambudwípa (in Asia); who
has the lord Siva, that bears the crescent of the moon on his
forehead, for his son-in-law.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. On the north of it, is a great peak with a plain land
above it, where the holy Súchí holds her hermitage, and
performs her rigorous devotion.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. What more shall I relate of her, than that she has
abstained herself even of her sustenance of air, and has
made a mess of her entrails coiled up together.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. She has contracted the opening of her mouth to a needle
hole, and stopped even that with a particle of dust, in order to
restrain it even from the reception of a cold dewdrop for its food.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. The fervour of her devotion, has made the snowy mountain
to forsake its coldness; and assume an igneous form which it
is difficult to approach. (The blaze of holiness is said to
set mountains on fire, as the presence of the Holy spirit set
the sacred mount of Sinai on flame).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>18. Therefore let all of us rise and repair soon to the great
father of creatures for redress; or know this fervent devotion
of hers must prove to our disadvantage in its result.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. Hearing these words pronounced by Pavana, the lord
Indra in company with the other gods, proceeded to the
abode of Brahmá, and prayed unto him for their safety.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. Brahmá answered:—“I am going even now to the summit
of the snowy Himalaya, to confer to Súchí her desired boon.”
Upon this assurance of Brahmá, the gods all returned to their
celestial abodes.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. During this time Súchí became perfect in her holiness,
and began to glow with the fervour of her devotion on the
mountain of the immortals.</p>

<p class='c009'>22. Súchí perceived very clearly the revolution of the time
(of her castigation), by fixing her open eyes on the sun, and
by counting the days by the rays of solar light penetrating
the opening of her mouth:—the needle hole.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. Súchí though flexible as a bit of thread, had yet attained
the firmness of the mountain Meru, by her erect posture.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. She beheld by the ray of sun light, which penetrated
the eye of the needle, that the shadowy attendant upon her
erect posture, was the only witness of her upright devotion.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. The shadow of Súchí which was the only attendant on her
devotion, hid herself under her feet for fear of the midday
heat, so do people in difficulty find their best friends
forsake their company in times of adversity.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. The union of the three persons of the iron, the ascetic and
shadowy Súchí, like the meeting of the three rivers (Asi, Varaná
and Gangá from three sides), described a triangle in the form
of the sacred city of Benares (or a delta of Gangá or the triune
divinity).</p>

<p class='c009'>27. This union of the three, like the confluence of three rivers
of a Trivení (as Ganga, Yamuna and Sarasvatí), purifies
the sins of men by the three different hues of their waters, <i>viz.</i>
the blue, black and white.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>28. A person becomes acquainted with the unknown cause of all,
only by <i>suchana</i> or reasoning in his own mind; and by
means of his selfconsciousness (of the truth or untruth of a
thing). It is the cogitation of one’s own mind that is best
guide in all things or else, O Ráma! there is no other better
preceptor for men.</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. Brahmá’s appearance, admonition and
blessing to Súchí and her resuscitation to life.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> continued:—After the lapse of a thousand
years of long and painful devotion, the great father of
creation (Brahmá), appeared to her under his pavilion of
the sky, and bade her accept the preferred boon.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Súchí who was absorbed in her devotion, and her vital
principle of life, remaining dormant in her, wanted the
external organs of sense (to give utterance to her prayer),
and remained only to cogitate upon the choice she should make.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. She said to herself: “I am now a perfect being, and am
delivered from my doubts; what blessing therefore is it, that I
have need of asking (either for myself or others), beyond this
state of beatitude; which I already possess in my peace and
tranquility, and the bliss of contentment and self-resignation.”</p>

<p class='c009'>4. I have got the knowledge of all that is to be known, and
am set free from the web of errors; my rationality is developed,
and what more is requisite to a perfect and rational being?</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Let me remain seated as I am in my present state, I am
in the light of truth; and quite removed from the darkness
of untruth; what else is there for me to ask or accept?</p>

<p class='c009'>6. I have passed a long period in my unreasonableness, and
was carried away like a child, by the demon of the evil genius
of earthly desires. (As a child wants to have everything he
sees, not knowing whether it is good or bad for him to have it).</p>

<p class='c009'>7. This desire is now brought under subjection by my power
of ratiocination, and of what avail are all the objects of my
desire to my soul? (There is nothing of any good to the soul,
for nothing temporal is of any spiritual good).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>8. The lord of creatures kept looking on Súchí sitting with
her mind fixed in her silent meditation, and resigned to her
destiny; and quite abstracted from all external sensations,
and the use of her bodily organs.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. Brahmá with the kindness of his heart, again accosted the
apathetic dame, and said unto her: “Receive thy desired blessing,
and live to enjoy for sometime longer on earth”.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. Then having enjoyed the joys of life, thou shalt attain
the blissful state from which thou shalt have no more to return
here, and this is the fixed decree destined for all living beings
on earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. Be thy desire crowned with success, by merit of this
devotion of thine, O best of the womankind! Resume thy
former corpulence, and remain as a Rákshasí in this
mountain forest.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. Regain thy cloud-like shape whereof thou art deprived at
present, and revive as a sprout from thy pinnate root, to become
like a big tree growing out of its small root and little seed.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. Thou shalt get an inward supply of serum from thy pinnate
tendon, as a plant gets its sap from the seeded grain; and the
circulation of that juice will cause thy growth like that of a
germ from the ingrained seed.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. Thy knowledge of truth has no fear of following into the
difficulties of the world; while on the contrary, the righteousness
of thy soul will lead thee like a huge cloud, that is heavy, with its
pure water high in the heaven, notwithstanding the blasting gusts
of wind. (<i>i.e.</i> The pure and contrite spirit goes on its wonted
course, in spite of the tribulations of the world).</p>

<p class='c009'>15. If by thy constant practice of Yoga meditation, thou hast
accustomed thyself to a state of habitation (death like Samádhi),
for thy intellectual delight, and hast there by become assimilated
to the <i>anaesthesia of</i> thy meditation (to the <i>state of a stock</i>
and stone).</p>

<p class='c009'>16. But thy meditativeness must be compatible with thy worldly
affairs, and the body like the breeze, is nourished best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>by its constant agitation. (<i>i.e.</i> Meditation must be joined
with utility, and the body with its activity).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. Therefore my daughter! thou dost act contrary to nature,
by withstanding the action which thy nature requires; nor can
there be any objection to thy slaughter of animal life under proper
bounds. (Because the carnivorous are made to live upon flesh, as
the omnivorous man upon all kinds of food).</p>

<p class='c009'>18. Act therefore within the bounds of justice, and refrain from
all acts of injustice in the world; and stick steadfastly to
reason, if thou shouldst like to live liberated in this life.
(Justice is the source of liberty, but injustice leads to bondage).</p>

<p class='c009'>19. Saying so far, the god disappeared from below to his
heavenly sphere, when Súchí said to him “be it so and I have
nothing to oppose to this”. Then thinking in her mind, that she
had no cause to be dissatisfied with the decree of the lotus-born
Brahmá, found herself immediately in possession of her former
body.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. She came to be of the measure of a span at first, and
then of a cubit; and next a full fathom in length; and
increasing fastly in her height, she grew up as a tree; till
at last she was of the form of a cloud. She had all the members
of the body added to her instantly, in the manner of the growth
of the arbour of human desire. (Our growing desires and their
increase, are compared with the growth and ramifications and
fructification of trees).</p>

<p class='c009'>21. From the fibrous form of Súchí (the needle), which was
without form or feature, body, blood, bones, flesh or strength,
there grew up all the parts and limbs at once. Just so the fancied
garden of our desire, springs up on a sudden with all its verdant
foliage and fruits and flowers from their hidden state.</p>

Argument. Advice of the god of winds to Karkatí; and
her resort to the Abode of Kiráta—flesh eaters.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> continued:—Súchí the needle now became the
fiend Karkatí again; and her leanness turned to bulkiness,
in the manner of a flimsy cloud; assuming a gigantic form
in the rainy season.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Now returning to her natal air and element, she felt some joy
in herself; but renounced her fiendish nature by the knowledge
she had gained; as a snake throws off its old slough.
(She was regenerated to a new life in the very same body).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. There seated in her <i>lotiform</i> posture, she continued to
reflect on her future course; and relying on the purity of her new
life and faith, she remained fixed as a mountain peak. (Unmoved
by the stormy temptations of the world).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. After six months of her continued meditation, she got the
knowledge of what she sought; as the roaring of clouds rouses
the peacock, to the sense of an approaching rain.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Being roused to her sense, she felt the pains of her thirst
and hunger; because the nature of the body never forsakes its
appetites as long as it lasts in the same state. (There cannot
be a thorough change of innate nature in the same person).</p>

<p class='c009'>6. She was sorrowful at last, not to find out what food she
should take to herself; because she thought the killing of
animal life for food, was unlawful and repugnant to her nature.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. The food forbidden by the respectable and got by unjust
means, must be rejected even at the expense of one’s valuable
life. (Respectable men abhor the flesh of unclean animals
and forbidden meat).</p>

<p class='c009'>8. If my body, said she, should perish for want of lawful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>food, I do not transgress the law in that; but the guilt lies
in my taking of unlawful food; for the sustenance of my life.
(Hence no man is guilty of his legal gain and lawful food).</p>

<p class='c009'>9. Whatever is not obtained according to the customary rules
of society, is not worth taking; and if I should die without
my proper food, or live upon improper fare, it amounts to the
same thing whether I live or die (because unrighteous living
is moral death).</p>

<p class='c009'>10. I was only the mind before, to which the body is added
as a base appendage. It vanishes upon the knowledge of self;
hence its care and neglect are both alike. (The soul forming
our true essence, must be preserved pure in expense of the
impure body).</p>

<p class='c009'>11. Vasishtha resumed:—As she was uttering these words, in
silence to herself, she heard a voice in the air, coming from
the god of winds, who was pleased at the renunciation of her
fiendish disposition.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. “Arise Karkatí”, it said, “and go to the ignorant and
enlighten them with the knowledge thou hast gained; for it
is the nature of the good and great, to deliver the ignorant
from their error.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. “Whosoever will not receive this knowledge (of lawful food),
when it is imparted to him by thee, make him verily the object
of thy derision, and take him as being a right meat and proper
food for thee.”</p>

<p class='c009'>14. On hearing these words she responded, “I am much
favoured by thee, kind god!”; and so saying, she got up and
descended slowly from the height of the craggy mountain.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. Having passed the heights, she came to the valley at the
foot of the mountain; and thence proceeded to the habitation
of the Kiráta people, who inhabit the skirts at the bottom
of the hills.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. She saw those places abounding in provisions of all sorts;
such as human kind and their cattle with their fodder and
grass. There were vegetable as well as animal food, with various
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>kinds of roots and plants. There were eatables and drinkables
also, with the flesh of deer and fowls, and even of reptiles
and insects.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. The nocturnal fiend then walked her way, under the shade
of the deep darkness of night, towards the habitation at the
foot of Himálaya, in her form of the sable mount of Anjanágiri
(unperceived by the inhabitants).</p>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> resumed:—It was a deep dark night, black as ink
and as thick as tangible pitch; hiding the habitation of
the Kirátas under its nigrescent umbrage. (Kirátas are the
present Kirántis of the Himalayas, and the ancient Kerrhoides
of Ptolemy).
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. The sky was moonless, and overcast by a veil of sable
clouds; the woodlands were obscured by tamála trees, and
thick masses of black clouds were flying about in the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. The thick furze and bushes besetting the hilly villages,
obstructed the passages by their impervious darkness, and the
flitting light of fireflies gave the homesteads an appearance
of the bridal night.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. The thick darkness spreading over the compounds of
houses, shut out the passage of the light of lamps,
which made their way of or from the chinks of the
dwelling in which they were burning.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Karkatí beheld a band of Pisáchis, dancing about her as her
companions; but she became motionless as a block of wood,
on seeing the giddy Vetálas, moving about with human skeletons
in their hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. She saw the sleeping antelopes by her, and the ground
matted over by the thick snow falls; while the drizzling
drops of dew and frost, were gently shaken by the breeze
on the leaves of trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. She heard the frogs croaking in the bogs, and the night
ravens cawing from the hollows of trees; while the mingled
noise of jocund men and women, were issuing from the inside
of the houses.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>8. She saw the <i>ignis fatuus</i> burning in the swamps, with the
lustre of portentous meteors; and found the banks and bournes,
thick with thorns and thistles, growing by their sides, and
washed by the waters gliding below them.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. She looked above and saw the groups of stars shining in
the firmament, and beheld the forest about her shaking their
fruit and flowers by the breeze.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. She heard the alternate and incessant cries of owls and
crows in the hollows of trees; and listened also the shouts of
robbers in the skirts, and the wailings of the villagers at a
distance.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. The foresters were silent in their native woods, and the
citizens were fast asleep in the cities; the winds were howling in
the forests, and the birds were at rest in their sylvan nests.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. Furious lions lay in their dens; and the deer were lying
in their caves also. The sky was full of hoarfrost, and the
woodlands were all still and quiet.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. The lightnings flashing from amidst the dark inky clouds,
resembled the reflexions of ray from the bosom of a crystal
mountain. The clouds were as thick as solid clay, and the
darkness was as stiff as it required to be severed by a sword.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. Blown by the storm, the dark cloud fled like the sable
Anjaná mountain in the air, and it deluged a flood of pitchy
rain, like a water-fall from the bosom of a mountain.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. The night was as dark as the pit of a coal-mine, and as
jet black as the wing of the black bee—<i>bhramara</i>; and the
whole landscape lulled to sleep, appeared as the world lying
submerged under ignorance. (Sleep and ignorance are twin brothers,
and a reversion of the comparison of ignorance with sleep.
Such reversed similes are not uncommon in oriental poetry, as
that of the moon with the beauteous face &amp;c.).</p>

<p class='c009'>16. In this dreadful dead of night, she saw in the district
inhabited by Kirátas, a prince and his minister, wandering
together in the forest.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. The prince was named Vikrama, and was as brave and
valorous as his name and conduct implied him to be. He came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>out undaunted from within the city, after the citizens had
fallen fast-asleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. Karkatí beheld them roving in the forest with the weapons
of their valour and fortitude, and searching the Vetálas infesting
the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. Seeing them, she was glad to think that she had at last
got her proper food; but wanted to know beforehand, whether
they were ignorant folks or had any knowledge of their souls,
or whether their weariness under the burthen of their bodies,
had exposed them to the dangers of the darksome night.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. The lives of the unlearned (said she), are verily for their
perdition in this world and the next; it is therefore meet to put
an end to these, rather than leave them to live to their peril in
both worlds. (The earlier the ignorant die, the sooner do they
rid themselves of their miseries and responsibilities).</p>

<p class='c009'>21. The life of the untutored is death, without spiritual
knowledge, and physical death is preferable; in as much as it
saves the dying soul from its accumulation of sin. (Living in
the sinful world is sin, unless it is averted by spiritual
knowledge).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. It is the primeval law ordained by our prime father—the
lotus-born Brahmá, that ignorant souls and those without
knowledge of their selves, should become the food of the
heinous. (<i>i.e.</i> Of voracious and envious animals, which
devour the body and not the soul).</p>

<p class='c009'>23. Therefore there is no harm in my feeding upon these two
persons, who have offered themselves for my food; because
it is silliness to let slip, a ready prize or proffered gift
from the hand. (A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
Or a self-given gift is not to be lost).</p>

<p class='c009'>24. But lest they should prove to be men of parts and good
and great souls, I cannot in that case feel disposed of my
own nature, to put an end to their valuable lives.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. I must therefore make a trial of them, and see if they
are possessed of such parts; that I may decline from making my
mess of them, because I feel averse to molest the intelligent.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>26. For those that expect to have true glory and real happiness,
with the length of their lives on earth; must always honour the
learned with honorariums, adequate to their parts and desires.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. I should rather suffer my body to perish with hunger,
than destroy the intelligent for its supportance; because the
soul derives more satisfaction from the counsels of the wise,
than bare life without knowledge, can possibly afford.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. The learned are to be supported even at the expense of one’s
own life; because the society of the wise affords a physic
to the soul (<i>psyches iatrion</i>), though death should deprive
us of our bodies (for it ameliorates even the pangs of death).</p>

<p class='c009'>29. Seeing me a man-eater Rákshasí, so favorably disposed
to the preservation of the wise; what reasonable man is there,
that must not make a breast-plate of the wise for himself. (<i>i.e.</i>
The wise are ornaments to human beings however inhumane
they may be to others of their fellow creatures. Hence the
most cruel tyrants were the greatest supporters of learning).</p>

<p class='c009'>30. Of all embodied beings, that move about on the surface of
the earth, it is the man of profound understanding only, who
sheds his benign influence like cooling moon-beams all around
him. (The light of knowledge is compared with the gentle
moonbeams).</p>

<p class='c009'>31. To be despised by the wise is death, and to be honoured
by the learned is true life; because it is the society of the
sapient only, that makes the life bring forth its fruits of
heavenly bliss and final beatitude.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. I will now put a few questions for their examination, and
know whether they are men of parts, or gilded on the surface
with sapient looks, like copper by a chemical process.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. Upon examination and ascertainment of the qualifications
if they prove to be wiser than the examiner; in that case
one should avail of their instruction, or otherwise there is no
harm to make an end of them as they best deserve.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXXVIII.<br></h2>
</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. The undaunted valour of the Prince, the Rákshasi’s
Questions and the Minister’s solution of them.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> continued:—Afterwards the Rákshasi, who
was an offshoot of the great garden of Rákshasa race, made
a loud and tremendous yell like the deep roarings of a cloud.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. After her deep roar she muttered in a clattering voice,
like the rattling of a thunder clap following the rumbling
of clouds.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. She said:—Ho, ho? what are ye, that venture abroad in this
dread and dreary desert, dark as the great delusion of Máyá,
and which without the light of the sun and moon, is as gloomy
as the gloom of ignorance. What are ye crawling here for like
insects bred in stones?</p>

<p class='c009'>4. What men of great minds are ye, to have come here as the
weak minded aberrants that have lost their way? You have become
an easy prey to me, and must meet your fate in my hands in
a moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. The Prince replied:—O thou demon, what art thou and
where is thy stand: If thou beest an embodied being, show
thyself unto us, or who is to be terrified by thy bodiless
form buzzing like a bee?</p>

<p class='c009'>6. It is the business of the brave to pounce at once like a lion
upon his prey (and not to bark as a dog at a distance). Therefore
leave off thy bragging and show us thy prowess at once.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Tell me what thou dost want of us, and whether thou
dost terrify us by thy vain vauntings, or utterest these
words from thy own fear of us.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Now measure thy body according to thy speech, (<i>i.e.</i> let
them conform with one another), and confront thyself to us
without delay; because the dilatory gain no good, save the
loss of their time.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. On hearing the prince’s speech she thought it was well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>said, and immediately showed herself to them, uttering her
loud shout with a grinning laughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. The prince heard her voice to fill the air, and resound in
the woods, and saw her huge and hideous person, by the light
of her open mouth and ivory teeth, in the act of her loud
laughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. Her body was as a huge cliff, hurled down by the thunder
bolt of the last doomsday (when high mountains were rent
and thrown into the sea to form their hidden rocks). The
flashes of her eyeballs blazed in the sky like a pair of
bangles or conch shells.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. The darkness of her appearance, cast into shade, the
deep dark waters of the deep at the universal deluge; which
hid the flame of the submarine fire under them; and her voice
was as hoarse as the growling of clouds on the high heads of
hills.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. Her statue was like that of a monumental pillar standing
between the heaven and earth; while the gnashing of her teeth
struck the night-rovers with the terror of being grinded under
them to death.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. Her figure inspired like those of the nocturnal goblins,
yakshas, Rákshas and Pisáchas, with the dread of dire disaster,
by its erect hairs, muscular limbs, dingy eyes and coal black
colour of the body.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. The air she breathed in the lungs, snored as the horrible
snorting of the nostrils of horses; while the tip of her nose was
as big as a mallet, and its sides as flat as a pair of bellows or
winnowing fans.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. She stood with her jet black body like a rock of dark
agate, and that joined with her loud laugh, gave her the
appearance of the all subduing night of dissolution.
(Kálarátri—the night of universal doom, is an attribute
of Kálí—the goddess of destruction).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. Her bulky body resembling a thick cloudy night,
approached to them like an autumnal cloud, moving
in the forest of the sky.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>18. The huge body appeared as a demon rising from
underneath the ground, and approaching to devour
them as the eclipse ingulfs the orbs of the sun
and moon.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. Her ebon breasts were hanging down, like two pendant
clouds of sombre sapphires, or more like the two mortars
or water pots, with her necklaces hanging on them.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. Her two arms were suspended to her bulky body, like a
couple of stout branches to the sturdy oak, or like two
logs of burnt wood to her coal like body.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. Seeing her thus, the two valiant men remained as
steadfast, as those standing on the firm ground of
certainty, are never led away by doubts.</p>

<p class='c009'>22. The Minister said:—O great friend! what causes this
rage and fury in thy great soul? It is the mean and base
only, that are ever violent even in trifling matters.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. Lay aside this great ado for nothing, which does not
become thee; because the wise pursue their business with
coolness to crown it with success.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. Know the soft and slow breath of our moderation, has
driven away in the air, swarms of such flies like thyself;
as the slight breath of the wind scatters about the dry
leaves and straws.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. Setting aside all hauteur and ardour of spirit, the
wiseman conducts his business with the calm coolness of
the mind, assisted by reason and practical wisdom.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. One must manage his affairs with slowness, whether
it prove effectual or not; because the overruling destiny has
the disposal of all events, which human ardour has no power
to prevent.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. Now let us know thy desire and what is thy object
with us; because no suitor of ours, has been refused of
his prayer, nor let to return in disappointment.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. Hearing these words, the Rákshasí pondered in her mind
and said:—O the serene composure of these lion-like men
and the affability of their conduct with others?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>29. I do not think them to be men of the ordinary kind, and
the more wonderful it is, that their inward soul is exprest in
the outward gestures of their faces and eyes, and in the tone
and tenor of their speech. (This is a truth of the Samudrika
science of physiognomy).</p>

<p class='c009'>30. The words, the face and eyes, are expressive of the inward
thoughts of the wise, and these go together like the salt
and water of the sea (which are inseparable from one another.
So Chanakya).—मनस्येकं वचस्येकं कर्म्मस्येकं महात्मनां । मनस्यन्यत् वचस्यन्यत् कर्म्मस्यन्यत् दुरात्मनां ॥
The mind, the word and act of the wise all agree. But those of
fools disagree in all the three.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. My intention is already known to them, as is theirs also to
me: they cannot be destroyed by me when they are indestructible
themselves by their moral excellence. (So the Sástra:—The
virtuous may endure or live for ever—<i>chiranjívati dharmátmá</i>.)</p>

<p class='c009'>32. I understand them to be acquainted with spiritual knowledge
also, without which there cannot be a good understanding.
Because it is the knowledge of the indestructibility of the
spirit, that takes away the fear of death which is wanting
in these men.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. I shall therefore ask them, about something wherein
I am doubtful; because they that fail to ask the wise what
they know not, must remain dunces throughout their lives.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. Having thought so, she opened her mouth to make her
queries, by suppressing her roaring voice and her loud
laughter for a while.</p>

<p class='c009'>35. Tell me, O ye sinless men, that are so brave and valiant,
who you are and whence ye come: because your very sight
has raised my regard for you, as the good hearted become
friends with one another, even at their first sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. The minister said:—This is the king of the Kirátas, and
I his counsellor; we have come out tonight in our nightly
round, for apprehending malicious beings like thyself.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>37. It is the duty of princes to punish the wicked, both by
day and night; for such as trespass the bounds of their duty,
must be made as fuel to the fire of destruction.</p>

<p class='c009'>38. The Rákshasí said:—Prince! thou hast a good minister,
but a bad one unbecomes a prince; all good princes have
wise counsellors, and they make the good prince.</p>

<p class='c009'>39. The wise minister is the prince’s guide to justice, and it
is he who elevates both the prince and his people. Justice is
the first of the four cardinal virtues (justice, temperance,
prudence and frugality), and it is the only virtue of a ruler;
who is thence called the <i>Dharma avatára</i> or personification
of justice.</p>

<p class='c009'>40. But kings must have spiritual knowledge also, because
it is the highest of human knowledge. The king having this
knowledge, becomes the best of kings; and the minister who
knows the soul, can give the best counsel for the guidance of
other souls. (For it is said:—Nándhenaiva níyamána yathándhah;
the blind cannot lead the blind. So the Gospel: one blind man
cannot lead another).</p>

<p class='c009'>41. It is the fellow feeling for others that makes a ruler,
whoever is unacquainted with this rule, is not fit to be either
a ruler or his minister. (The rule is: Rule others as ye rule
yourselves. <i>Sadhi swátmá vadanyán</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>42. If ye know this polity, it is good and ye shall prosper,
or else ye wrong yourselves and your subjects; in which case
ye must be made a prey to me. (Because if you have no regard
for your own souls and those of others, why should I have any
regard for yours?)</p>

<p class='c009'>43. There is but one expedient for you two lads, to escape
from my clutches; and it is by your solution of my intricate
questions; according to your best wits and judgment. (The
queries are said to be <i>prasna pinjara</i> or the cage or
prison-house of dilemmas; in which sense the text should read
<i>vidárayasi</i> for <i>vichárayasi</i>, to mean that, if you cannot
break the knots, I will not stop to break your necks).</p>

<p class='c009'>44. Now do you, O prince and you his counsellor, give me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>the solution of the questions that I require of you. If you fail
to give the proper answers as you have agreed to do, you must
then fall under my hands, as any body that fails to keep his
words. (The breach of a promise was punishable with death by
the old Hindu law. Hence the first question; “Why am I
obliged in keeping my word” in Paley’s Moral philosophy).</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. Seventy questions of Karkatí, which are hard for
the unlearned but too plain to the wise. They are intricate
for their riddling nature to boys, but plain by their double
sense to the learned.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> continued:—After saying so, the fiend began
to put forth her queries; and you should be attentive to
them Ráma, like the prince who told her to go on.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. The Rákshasí resumed:—What is that atomic minim
which is one yet many, and as vast as the ocean, and which
contains innumerable worlds like the bubbles of the sea?
(It is a minim for its minuteness, an atom—owing to its
imperceptibility, one—as regards its unity, many—on account
of its attributes (upádhis), and vast in respect to its
infinity, containing the passing worlds as the evanescent
bubbles of water).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. What is that thing which is a void yet no-void, which is
something yet nothing? What is it that makes myself, and
thyself, and wherein do I or thou dost abide and subside?
(It is nothing in appearance, but something in our consciousness,
and is both the subjective and objective).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. What is it that moveth unmoved and unmoving, and standeth
without stopping; what is it that is intelligent yet as dull
as a stone; and what is it that presents its variety in the
vacuity of the understanding? (Another text reads <i>vyomni
chitra krit</i>, which means: who paints the sky with variegated
hues).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. What is it that has the nature of fire without its burning
quality; and what is that unigneous substance which produces
the fire and its flame. (This passage refers to the glory and
light of God which shines without burning).</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Who is he that is not of the nature of the ever-changing
solar, lunar and stellar lights, but is the neverchanging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>enlightener of the sun, moon and stars; and who is that being
who having no eyes, gives the eye its sight?</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Who is he that gives eyesight to the eyeless vegetables, and
the blind mineral creation? (Whereby they perceive the light of
the luminaries of heaven as the sunflower moonflower—<i>helioselini</i>
and others).</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Who is the maker of heavens, and who is the author of the
natures of things; who is the source of this gemming world,
and whose treasure are all the gems contained in it? (Man
foolishly owns them for a time, but leaves at last to their
true possessor and maker).</p>

<p class='c009'>9. What is that monad which shines in darkness, and is that point
which is and is not; what is that iota which is imperceptible
to all, and what is that jot which becomes an enormous
mountain? (A geometrical monad is a point without dimension.
In the Monadology of Leibnitz, it is the elementary
particle of vital force acting not mechanically, but from
internal principle. It is the entelechy of Aristotle, whose
essence consists in force).</p>

<p class='c009'>10. To whom is a twinkling of the eye, as long as a <i>Kalpa</i>
millennium; and a whole age but a moment? Who is he whose
omnipresence is equal to his absence, and whose omniscience is
alike his total ignorance? (<i>i.e.</i> To whom eternity is a moment,
and whose omnipresence and omniscience are unknown to us).</p>

<p class='c009'>11. Who is called the spirit, but is no air in itself; and who
is said to be the sound or word, but is none of them himself?
He is called the All, but is none at all of all that exists; and
he is known as Ego, but no ego is he himself. (<i>Spiritus</i> or the
breathing of <i>ventus</i>-wind-<i>prána</i> and the <i>sabda-sonus</i> or Sruti
are not God; nor is he one and all in his person, nor the ego and
non-ego, I not I, and <i>le moi et non le moi</i>, <i>das Ich und nicht Ich</i>, the
subjective and objective, and having no personality of his own).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. What is it that is gained by the greatest application, of
a great many births (lives), and when gained at last, is hard
to be retained (owing to the spiritual carelessness of mankind)?
(Liberation by final extinction—<i>nirvána</i>, is hard to be had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>owing to the interminable metempsychosis of the soul, according
to the doctrine of the pre-existence and immortality of souls).</p>

<p class='c009'>13. Who being in easy circumstances in life, has not lost his
soul in it; and who being but an atom in creation, does not
reckon the great mountain of Meru as a particle? <i>i.e.</i> the
egotist. (It is harder for the easy rich to enter the kingdom
of heaven, than for a camel to enter the eye of a needle. Gospel.
The pride of egotism levels mountains to dust, and its ambition
soars above them).</p>

<p class='c009'>14. What is that which being no more than an atom, fills
a space of many leagues; and who is an atomic particle; that
is not contained (measured) in many miles? (It is the atomic
theism of Kanáda’s Vaiseshika system and of Ecphantus and
Archelaus. The mind is included in the atomism of Empedocles
and Anaxagoras. Epicurus added morality to it, and Lucretius
added to it the beauty of poetry also. See also the Ateistic
Atomic systems of Leucippus and Democritus).</p>

<p class='c009'>15. At whose glance and nod is it, that all beings act their
parts as players; and what is that ace which contains in its
bosom many a mountain chain? (The mountain was produced
from and is contained in the atom of the divine mind; and so
every grain of the human brain, contains in it the form of a
prodigious mountain).</p>

<p class='c009'>16. Who is it, that is bigger than the mount Meru in his
minuteness; and who is it that being, lesser than the point
of a hair, is yet higher than the highest rock? (So the sruti:
<i>Anor-aniyán mahato mahiyán: i.e.</i> Minuter than the minutest
and bigger than the biggest).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. Whose light was it, that brought out the lamp of light
from the bosom of darkness; and what minute particle is it,
that contains the minutiae of ideas <i>ad infinitum</i> in it?
(God said “<i>Lux fiat et lux fit.</i>” Genesis. Hail holy
light Heaven’s first born. Milton. Eternal ideas of immaterial
forms of possible existences in the Divine Mind, the archetype
of the ectypal world. These are the Types of things, Plato;
Forms of ditto. Cicero. Eternal exemplars of things. Seneca &amp;c.).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>18. Which having no flavour in it, gives savour to all things; and
whose presence being withdrawn from all substances, reduces them to
infinitesimal atoms, (<i>i.e.</i> by destruction of cohesion. So the
Sruti.—<i>Raso vai tat.</i>—He is flavour etc. Attraction of all kinds, is
a manifestation of Divine power—<i>ákrishti</i>, personified in the form of
Krishna—the regent of the sun, whose gravity supports the solar world).</p>

<p class='c009'>19. Who is it that by his self-pervasion, connects the particles
composing the world (as by their power of attraction); and what
imperceptible power is it, that rejoins the detached particles,
after their separation and dissolution for recreation of the new
world? (The atomic powers of attraction and repulsion of particles
and bodies).</p>

<p class='c009'>20. Who being formless, has a thousand hands and eyes; and
a twinkling of whose eye, comprehends the period of many cycles
together? (The divine hypostases of Viráj, is endowed with a
thousand hands and eyes, as in the Purusha Súkta: Sahasra sirsha,
sahasra váhu sahasráxa &amp;c.).</p>

<p class='c009'>21. In what microscopic mite does the world subsist as an
arbor in its seed, and by what power do the unproductive
seeds of atoms, become productive of worlds?</p>

<p class='c009'>22. Whose glance is it, that causes the production of the
world, as from its seed; and who is it that creates the world
without any motive or material? (The motives are the subjective
or internal cause and the objective or external objects of
creation. And material means the matter of unisubstantism of
materialists).</p>

<p class='c009'>23. What is that being, who without his visual organs, enjoys the
pleasure of seeing—<i>Drishti</i>; and is the viewer—<i>drashtá</i> of
Himself, which he makes the object of his view (drishya). <i>i.e.</i>
God sees all things in himself as the receptacle of all in the
eternal ideas of them in his mind. Or. The Ego meditates on
itself both subjectively as the viewer, and objectively as the
view. (So Milton, “And God saw his works were good”
answering his fair idea).</p>

<p class='c009'>24. Who is he that having no object of vision before him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>sees nothing without him, but looks upon himself as an infinity
void of all visibles within it. (This is the subjective reflection
of the Yogi, like that of God on his ownself, as abstracted from
the thought of all other things. The Mind is the subjective
reality and matter has no objective reality).</p>

<p class='c009'>25. Who is it, that shows the subjective sight of the soul by
itself, as an objective view; and represents the world as the figure
of a bracelet, in his own metal? (<i>i.e.</i> The subjective soul and
the metal are the true realities, and the objective view of the
jewel and the world, is but error and delusion. The Vedantist like
Berkeley, held all objective reality to be subjective).</p>

<p class='c009'>26. Who is it that has nothing existent beside himself, and
in whom all things exist, like the waves existing in the waters;
and who is it whose will makes them appear as different things?
(The one being no more than fluctuations of the other, and
substantially the same).</p>

<p class='c009'>27. Both time and space are equally infinite and indivisible,
as the essence of God wherein they subsist, why then do we try to
differentiate and separate them like the water from its fluidity?</p>

<p class='c009'>28. What is the inward cause in us, which makes the believer
in the soul, to view the unreal world as real, and why does
this fallacy continue at all times?</p>

<p class='c009'>29. The knowledge of the worlds whether as present, past or
<i>in futuro</i>, is all a great error; and yet what is that
immutable being, which contains in it the seed of this
phenomenal wilderness?</p>

<p class='c009'>30. What being is that, which shows these phenomena without
changing itself, such as in the shape of the seed of the world,
before it developes itself in creation; and sometimes in the form
of a developed forest of created beings?</p>

<p class='c009'>31. Tell me, O prince! on what solid basis does the great
Meru, stand like a tender filament of the lotus; and what gigantic
form is that, which contains thousands of Merus and Mandaras
within its capacious womb?</p>

<p class='c009'>32. Tell me, what is that immeasurable Intellect, which has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>spread these myriads of intelligences in all these worlds; what
is that which supplies thee with thy strength for ruling and
protecting thy people, and in conducting thyself through life;
and what is it in whose sight, thou dost either lose thyself or
thinkest to exist? Tell me all these, O clear sighted and fair
faced prince, for the satisfaction of my heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. Let thy answer melt down the doubt, that has covered the
face of my heart as with snows. If it fail to efface this dirt
of doubt altogether from the surface of my heart, I will never
account it as the saying of the wise.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. But if thou fail to lighten my heart of its doubts, and
set it at ease; then know for certain, that thou shalt immediately
be made a fuel to the fire of my bowels at this very moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>35. I shall then fill this big belly of mine with all the people
of thy realm; but shouldst thou answer rightly, thou shalt reign
in peace; or else thou shalt meet thy end like the ignorant, who
are surfeited with the enjoyments of life.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. Saying so, the nocturnal fiend made the loud shout of a
roaring cloud, expressive of her joy; and then sat silent with her
fearful features, like a light hearted cloud in autumn (which is of
gigantic shape, but empty of rain waters within).</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXXX.<br> <br><span class="smcap">Solution of the Questions.</span><br></h2>
</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. First the Counsellor’s reply to the Questions.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> continued:—After the giant-like progeny of
the Rákshasa had proposed her occult questions, in the
deep gloom of night in that thick forest, the good and great
counsellor began to give his replies. (The repetition of the word
great in the original, expresses the solemnity of the occasion; as
the disquisitions concerning the Great God in the Áranyakas or
forest lectures of the vedic Rishis, were conducted with great
solemnity in their holy hermitage in forests. So was the Sermon
on the Mount of Jesus).
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. The Counsellor said:—Hear, me! thou dark and cloud like
form! to unravel thy riddling questions, with as great ease as
the lion foils the fury of gigantic elephants.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. All thy questions relate to the Supreme Spirit, and are
framed in thy enigmatical language, to try the force of our
penetration into their hidden meanings.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. The soul which is Selfsame with the intellect which is
minuter than a particle of air, is that atomic principle that thou
dost inquire into, because it is a nameless minim imperceptible by
the six organs of sense, and unintelligible to the mind. (Answer
to the first question about the atom. अणु).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Underlying the atomic intellect, is the minute seed which
contains this universe; but whether it is a substantial or
unsubstantial reality, nobody can say. (This is the answer
to the second question with regard to the mundane seed).</p>

<p class='c009'>6. It is called a reality from our notion of its being the soul of
all by itself, and it is from that soul that all other existences
have come in to being. (Answer about the nature of God).</p>

<p class='c009'>7. It is a void from its outward inanity, but it is no void as
regards its intellect (which is a reality); it is said to be nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>from its imperceptibility, but it is a subtile something from its
imperishableness. (All finite bodies are unreal, the immortal
soul is real, and identic with the Supreme soul).</p>

<p class='c009'>8. It is not a nothing from its being permeated in all things,
(<i>i.e.</i> though all pervading yet it is an absolute entity); for all
things are but reflexions of the minute Intellect, and its unity
shines forth in the plurality, all which is as unreal, as the formal
bracelet formed of the substantial gold.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. This minutial is the transcendental vacuum, and is imperceptible
owing to its minuteness; and though it is situated in all things,
yet it is unperceived by the mind and external senses.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. Its universal pervasion cannot make it void and null, because
all that is (existent) is not that (Intellect), which alone
is known as the thinking principle, that makes us speak, see
and act.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. No kind of reasoning can establish the non-entity of
the real Ens (sat), because of it is not being seen by anybody.
Yet the universal soul is known in its hidden form, like the
unseen camphor by its smell.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. The unlimited soul resides in all limited bodies, and the
atomic intellect pervades the vast universe; and it is in the same
manner as the mind fills all bodies, in its purely subtile state
unknown to the senses.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. It is one and all, the unity as well as plurality, by its
being the soul of each and all, both singly as well as collectively,
and its supporting and containing each and all by and within
itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. All these worlds are as little billows in the vast ocean of
the divine Intellect; whose intelligence, like a liquid body,
shows itself in the form of eddies in the water. (Hence nothing
is different from the Supreme).</p>

<p class='c009'>15. This minutiae of the intellect being imperceptible to
the senses and the mind, is said to be of the form of vacuity;
but being perceived by our consciousness, it is not a nothing,
although of the nature of a void in itself.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>16. I am That and so art thou, by our conviction of the
unity (of the spirit); but neither am I That nor thou art He,
by believing ourselves as composed of our bodies only. (It is in
answer of what art thou &amp;c. Spiritually considered all souls are
the same with the supreme; but being viewed in the body, all
bodies are different from one another, and quite apart from
their unity with the Divine spirit).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. Our egoism and tuism being got rid of by our knowledge of
truth, we cease to be the <i>ego</i> and <i>tu</i>; and so all other
persons lose all their properties (<i>svayam</i> or <i>suum</i>) in the sole
Unity. (This is an enlargement of the preceding answer to the
question—What art thou &amp;c.).</p>

<p class='c009'>18. This particle of the intellect is immovable, though it moves
thousand of miles over; and we find in our consciousness many a
mile to be composed in this particle. (The mind notwithstanding
its wide range, never stirs from its seat in the soul).</p>

<p class='c009'>19. The mind is firmly seated in the vacuous intellect, from
which it never stirs, though it goes to all places where it is
never located. (This is the answer of what moveth not).</p>

<p class='c009'>20. That which hath its seat in the body can never go out
of it; as a baby hanging on the breast of its mother, cannot
look to another place for its rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. One though free to range over large tracts at will, will
never start from his own abode, where he has the liberty and
power to do all he likes.</p>

<p class='c009'>22. Wherever the mind may rove, it is never affected by the
climate of that place; as a jar taken to a distant country
with its mouth shut, does not yield any passage to the light
and air of that region into it. (In answer to what remains in
a place so as it does not remain there).</p>

<p class='c009'>23. The cogitation and incogitancy of the intellect, being
both perceived in our minds, it is said to be both intellection
as well as dullness of the intellect. (This is the answer “of
what is ever active, yet as dull as a block of stone”).</p>

<p class='c009'>24. When our intellection is assimilated into the solid substance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>of Divine Intellect, then is our intellect said to become
solidified as a stone. (By forgetting one’s self to a stone. Pope).</p>

<p class='c009'>25. The worlds which the intellect of the Supreme Being
has spread in the infinite space, are the most wonderful as they
are his increate creations. (These being but manifestations of
his inborn essence).</p>

<p class='c009'>26. The Divine Soul is of the essence of fire, and never
forsakes its igneous form. It inheres in all bodies without
burning them, and is the enlightener and purifier of all
substances. (This answers the question, “what is fiery
without its inflammability”).</p>

<p class='c009'>27. The blazing intelligence of the divine soul, which is purer
than the etherial sphere, produces the elemental fire by its
presence. (As the burning of mount Sinai in the Bible and
Taurus in the Koran, and the fiery form of Brahmá the creator
and regent of vulgar fire).</p>

<p class='c009'>(This is in answer of “what unigneous entity produces the
substance of fire?”).</p>

<p class='c009'>28. The intellect which is the light of the soul, and enlightener
of the lights of the luminous sun, moon and stars,
is indestructible and never fades; although the light of the
luminaries, is lost on the last day of universal doom. (In answer
to “what unextinguishable fire is the kindler of planetary
lights”).</p>

<p class='c009'>29. There is an inextinguishable light (glory), known as
ineffably transcendental, which the eye cannot behold, but is
perceptible to the mind as its inward illumination, and presenting
all things to its view. (Answer to “what light imperceptible
to the eye, brings all things to view?” This is spiritual light).</p>

<p class='c009'>30. Thence proceeds the intellectual light, which transcends
the sensible and mental lights; and presents before it wonderful
pictures of things invisible to visual light. (It is luminous by
itself and shows things lying hid in darkness, as one walking in
the dark, makes himself known to another by telling him
“it is I”).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>31. The eyeless vegetable creation, is sensible of an inward
light within them, causing their growth and giving them the
capability of bearing their fruits and flowers. (In answer to
the question regarding the light and life of vegetable creation,
which are also classed under animated nature).</p>

<p class='c009'>32. With regard to time, space and action and existence
of the world, all which are but the <i>percepta</i> or perceptions of
sense, and have no master or maker, father or supporter except
the Supreme Soul in whom they subsist, as mere modifications
of himself and are nothing of themselves. (It is in answer to
the question, “who is the maker of the skies &amp;c.”).</p>

<p class='c009'>33. The atomic spirit is the casket of the bright gem of the
world, without changing its minuteness. The divine spirit is
its measure and measurer, beside which there is no separate
world of itself. (Answer to the question “who is the holder
and measurer of the world”).</p>

<p class='c009'>34. It is that Spirit which manifests itself in every thing
in all these worlds; but it shines as the brightest gem, when
all the worlds are compressed in it (at the universal dissolution).</p>

<p class='c009'>35. From the unintelligibleness of his nature, he is said to
be a speck of obscurity, as he is called to be a ray of light, from
the brightness of his intellect. He is known as existent by
our consciousness of him, as he is said to be non-existent from
his being removed from our visual sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. He is said to be afar from his invisibleness to our eyes,
and to be near us from his being of the nature of our intellect.
He is represented as a mountain for his being the totality of
our consciousness, although he is minuter than any perceptible
particle. (In answer to “what is minute yet vast”).</p>

<p class='c009'>37. It is his consciousness that manifests itself in the form
of the universe; the mountains are not real existences, but subsist
like the Meru in his atomic substratum. (In answer to
the question “how an atom contains and expands itself as a
hill &amp;c.”).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>38. A twinkling is what appears as a short instant, and
a Kalpa is the long duration of an age. (It is definitive proposition
of identity, that a <i>nimesha</i> is a <i>nimesha</i> and a <i>Kalpa</i> is
a <i>Kalpa</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>39. Sometimes a twinkling—instant represents a Kalpa, when
it is fraught with the acts and thoughts of an age; as an
extensive country of many leagues, is pictured in miniature
or in a grain of the brain.</p>

<p class='c009'>40. The course of a long <i>Kalpa</i>, is sometimes represented in
the womb of a <i>nimesha</i> instant; as the period of the building
of a great city, is present in the small space of the mind’s
remembrance, as it is in the bosom of a mirror.</p>

<p class='c009'>41. As little moments and Kalpa ages, high mountains and
extensive <i>yojanas</i>, may abide in a single grain of the
intellect; so do all dualities and pluralities unite and meet
in the unity of God.</p>

<p class='c009'>42. That ‘I have done this and that before’, is an impression
derived from the thought of our actual actions and activity at
all times; but the truth thereof becomes as untrue as our doings
in the dream. (This to prove that all <i>vyávahárika</i> or customary
events, are real untruths; being but <i>prátibhásika</i> or phenomenal
appearances only).</p>

<p class='c009'>43. It is calamity that prolongs the course of time, as our
prosperity on the otherhand diminishes its duration; as the
short space of a single night, appeared as a period of twelve
long years to king Haris Chandra in his misery. (The fallacy
of human conception of the length or shortness of time).</p>

<p class='c009'>44. Anything appearing as a certain truth to the mind, stamps
the same impression in the soul, as the sense of some golden
jewellery, becomes more impressive in the soul than the idea
of its gold. (The fallacy of our perceptions, creating errors
in the judgement of the understanding).</p>

<p class='c009'>45. There is nothing as a moment or an age or as near or afar
to the soul; it is the conception in the minute intellect
(or the working of the mind), that creates their length or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>brevity and their nearness and remoteness. (As a year of men
is a day of Gods, and such a year of these makes a day of Brahmá;
while there is no measure of time or space in the infinity
of the Divine mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>46. The contraries as light and darkness, nearness and distance,
and a moment and an age, being but varied impressions on the
unvaried percipient mind, have no real difference in them. (They
are as unreal as the various evanescent hues of the recipient
and reflexive clouds. So no colour is real chromatics or
Science of colours).</p>

<p class='c009'>47. All things or objects which are perceptible to the senses,
are called to be evident or apparent; and those which lie beyond
them, are said to be imperceptible or unapparent. But visual
sensation is not selfevident, except the vision of the intellect,
which is the real essence. (In answer to the question “What
is perceptible and unreal?” Answer—All what is apparent, is
untrue).</p>

<p class='c009'>48. As long as there is the knowledge of the jewel, there
is the knowledge of the gem also; that of the real gem, being
lost under the apparent form. (So reliance on ocular evidence,
presents an obstruction to the vision of the intellect).</p>

<p class='c009'>49. It is by reversion of the attention from the visible form
of the jewel to the real essence of the gem, that one is led to
the sight of the pure light of the only One Brahma. (So says
a poet:—Forsake the visible to see the invisible).</p>

<p class='c009'>50. Brahma is viewed as Sat or reality, when He is considered
as pervading all things; and He is said to be Asat or unreal,
because He is not the object of vision. So is the Intellect
said to be a reality from its faculty of intellection, otherwise
it is a stolid or dull matter. (Answers to “what reality
appears as unreal, and what intellect as the absence of intellect”).</p>

<p class='c009'>51. The intellect is the wonderful property of the Divine
Spirit, in which it is present as its object (chetya); but how
can a man have a view of it, whose mind fixed to the sight of
the world, which is a shadow of the Intellect, and moves as
a tree which is shaken by the wind?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>52. As a mirage is the reflexion of the dense light of the
sun, so is the world a shadow of the solid light of the
Divine intellect.</p>

<p class='c009'>53. That which is rarer than the rays of the sun and never
decays, is ever as uniform as it was before creation and
disjoined from it. Hence its existence is tantamount to its
nonexistence.</p>

<p class='c009'>54. As the accumulation of sunbeams, exhibits the formation
of a gold mine in the sky; so the golden appearance of the
world, prevents the deluded to look to the knowable object of
the intellect.</p>

<p class='c009'>55. Like the appearance of a visionary city in dream, the
sight of this world is neither a reality nor altogether unreal;
because it is a reflexion of the intellect, as the dream is that
of images in the memory. It is but a continued medley of error.</p>

<p class='c009'>56. Knowing it as such, men should consider everything
by the light of reason; and proceed to the knowledge of
truth by their intellectual culture.</p>

<p class='c009'>57. There is no difference between a house and a void, than
that the one is the object of vision, and the other of
consciousness. Again all nature teeming with life, is said
to live in God, who is light and life of all for evermore.</p>

<p class='c009'>58. But all these living beings have no room in the empty
sphere of Divine Intellect. They live and shine like the
solar rays, proceeding imperceptibly from that luminous orb.</p>

<p class='c009'>59. There appears a difference in these rays both from the
original light, and also from one another (in different beings),
by a curious design of Providence; but it is yet the same in
all, like the forms of the trees growing out of the same kind
of seed.</p>

<p class='c009'>60. As the tree contained in the seed, is of the same kind
with the parent seed; so the innumerable worlds contained
in the vacuous seed of Brahma, are also void and vacuum as
Brahma himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>61. As the tree which is yet undeveloped in the seed, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>not <i>in esse</i> without development of its parts; (so the world in
the womb of Brahma, was discernible only to the Divine Intellect;
in the form of the ideal or spiritual world to be <i>in futuro</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>62. There is but one God, who is one and increate, calm
and quiet, without beginning, middle or end, and without a
body and its parts. He has no duality and is one in many.
He is of the form of pure light, and shines for ever with
everlasting and undiminished lustre.</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. The Prince’s Answers to the
Remaining Questions of the Rákshasí.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> Rákshasí said:—Well said, O counsellor! Thy sayings are
sanctifying and fraught with spiritual doctrines; now let the
prince with his eyes like lotus-leaves answer to the other queries.
 </p>

<p class='c009'>2. The Prince answered:—He whose belief consists in the
relinquishment of all reliance in this world, and whose
attainment depends upon forsaking all the desires of the
heart:—</p>

<p class='c009'>3. He whose expansion and contraction causes the creation and
extinction of the world, who is the object of the doctrines
of Vedánta, and who is inexpressible by words or speech of
humankind:—</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Who is betwixt the two extremities of doubt (whether he is or
is not), and is the midst of both extremities (that both he is
and is not); and the pleasure (Will) of whose mind, displays the
world with all its movables and immovables to view:—</p>

<p class='c009'>5. He whose Universal pervasion does not destroy his unity; who
being the soul of all is still but one; it is he alone, O lady!
who is truly said to be the eternal Brahma (so far the Exordium).</p>

<p class='c009'>6. This minute particle is erroneously conceived as spirit (air),
from its invisibleness to the naked eye; but it is in truth neither
air nor any other thing except the only pure Intellect. (Answer
to the question, “what is it of the form of air and not air?”).</p>

<p class='c009'>7. This minim is said to be sound (or the words), but it is
error to say it so: because it is far beyond the reach of sound
or the sense of words. (So the Sruti ‘<i>natatravákgacchati</i>’, no
word (vox or voice) can reach unto him—express his nature.
(In answer to the query “what is sound and no sound?”)).</p>

<p class='c009'>8. That particle is all yet nothing, it is neither I, thou or he.
It is the Almighty soul and its power is the cause of all. (The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>gloss explains <i>pratibha</i> as <i>sakti</i> or power, in preference to the
other meanings of the word, as—knowledge, design, light, reflexion
and influence. (This is in answer to “who is all yet no one
<i>omnium et nullum</i>, and what are I, thou and he, which are viewed
as the <i>ego</i>, <i>tu</i> and <i>ille</i>, the subjective and objective realities”)).</p>

<p class='c009'>9. It is the soul that is attainable with great pains (<i>i.e.</i> the
knowledge of which is gained with pains of Yoga), and which
being gained adds nothing to our stock (as we are already in
possession of our souls); but its attainment is attended with
the gain of the supreme soul, than which there is no better gain.
(So the Sruti <i>yalalábhat naparamlabha</i>. In answer to ‘what gain
is no gain’).</p>

<p class='c009'>10. But ignorance of the soul, stretches the bonds of our
worldliness and repeated transmigrations, with their evils
growing like the rankest weeds in spring; until they are
rooted out by spiritual knowledge.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. And those who are in easy circumstances in life, lose their
souls by viewing themselves only as solid bodies, which rise
fastly to view like the dense mirage by light of the sun. (It is
easier for a camel to enter the hole of a needle, than for the
rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. Gospel).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. It is the particle of self-consciousness, which contains the
Meru and the three worlds, like bits of straw in itself. They are
as disgorged from it in order to present their delusive appearances
unto us. (This answers the question: “what particle hides in it
the world as a straw,” and means the mind to be the container
of the universe).</p>

<p class='c009'>13. Whatever is imprinted in the intellect, the same appears
exprest without it. The fond embrace of passionate lovers in
dream and imagination, serves to exemplify this truth.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. As the intellect rose of itself with its omnipotent Will at the
first creation of the world, so it exercises the same volition in
its subsequent formations also, like the sprigs rising from the
joints of reeds and grass. (i.e. The eternal Will (Fiat) is
productive of all things for ever).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>15. The hobby that has entered in the heart, shows itself on
the outside also, as in the instance of the whims of children.
(The phrases, “the wish being father to the thought,” and “every
one delights in his hobby horse,” correspond with the purport of
the passage).</p>

<p class='c009'>16. The iota of the intellect, which is as minute as an atom, and
as subtile as air; fills the whole universe on all sides. (The
three words <i>paramánu</i>, <i>anu</i> and <i>súkshma</i>, respectively signify the
minuteness of the intellect with regard to its unity, dimension
and rarity. Gloss).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. Though but a particle, yet it is not contained in hundreds
of leagues; and being all-pervasive it is infinite. Having no
beginning it is measureless, and having no form of itself it is
formless. (In answer to ‘what minutiae is immeasurable &amp;c.’).</p>

<p class='c009'>18. As a cunning coxcomb deludes young girls by their becks
and calls and winks and glances. (Quips and cranks and
wanton wiles; Nods and becks and wreathed smiles. Pope):—</p>

<p class='c009'>19. So the holy look of the divine intellect, serves as a prelude to
the rotatory dance of worlds, with all their hills and contents for
ever (<i>i.e.</i> a nod and look of the Almighty, moves the worlds).</p>

<p class='c009'>20. It is that atom of the intellect, which envelops all things
within its consciousness, and represents also their forms without
it; as a picture canvas shows the figures of the hills and
trees drawn in it, to stand out as in bas-relief. (The external
world being but a prominent representation of the internal, the
phenomenal of the noumenal. So Persian: <i>Suvaribatini</i> and
<i>Zahiri</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>21. The divine spirit though as minute as the hundredth part of
the point of a hair, is yet larger than the hills it hides in itself,
and as vast as infinity, being unlimited by any measure of space
or time. (In answer to “what is it that retains its minuteness
and yet comprehends the great Meru”).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. The comparison of the vast vacuity of divine understanding
with a particle of air (as it is made by the minister), is not
an exact simile. It is as a comparison of a mountain with a
mustard seed, which is absurd.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>23. The minuteness which is attributed to it (in the veda),
is as false as the attribution of different colours to the plumage
of the peacock, and of jewellery to gold, which can not be
applicable to the spirit. (The Veda says, <i>anoraníyan</i>. He is
minuter than the minute &amp;c.; because the spirit admits no attribute).</p>

<p class='c009'>24. It is that bright lamp which has brought forth light
from its thought, and without any loss of its own essential
effulgence. (Answer to “What lamp gave light in darkness?”
“He was the light of the world, and the light shine forth in
darkness,” Gospel).</p>

<p class='c009'>25. If the sun and other luminous bodies in the world, were
dull and dark in the beginning; then what was the nature
of the primeval light and where did it abide? (This question
is raised and answered by the prince himself in the next).</p>

<p class='c009'>26. The pure essence of the mind which was situated in the
soul, saw the light displayed on the outside of it, by its internal
particle of the intellect. Gloss:—That light existed inside the
intellectual atom before creation, and its preceding darkness;
it was afterwards set forth by itself without it, when it shone
amidst the darkness. (So the passage, <i>lux fiat et lux fit</i>, and then
the mind beheld it, and said it was good).</p>

<p class='c009'>27. There is no difference in the lights of the sun, moon and
fire from the darkness, out of which these lights were produced:
the difference is only that of the two colours black and white.
(Gloss:—Both of them are equally insensible things).</p>

<p class='c009'>28. As the difference of the cloud and snows, consists in the
blackness of the one and whiteness of the other; such is the
difference of light and darkness in their colours only, and not
in their substance (as they have no real substantiality in
them).</p>

<p class='c009'>29. Both of these being insensible in their natures, there is no
difference between them: and they both disappear or join with one
another before the light of intellect. They disappear before the
intellectual light of the Yogi, who perceives no physical
light or darkness in his abstract meditation under the blaze
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>of his intellect. They join together as light and shade,—the
shadow inseparably following the light. The adage goes, <i>Zer
cheragh tariki</i>:—there is darkness beneath the lighted lamp.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. The sun of the intellect, shines by day and night without
setting or sleeping; It shines in the bosom even of hard stones,
without being clouded or having its rise or fall.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. The light of this blazing soul, has lighted the sun, which
diffuses its light all over the three worlds; it has filled the
capacious womb of earth with a variety of provisions, as they
lay up large panniers of food in a store-house. (<i>i.e.</i> It is the
sun-light that grows and ripens all things for our food).</p>

<p class='c009'>32. It enlightens darkness without destroying itself, and the
darkness that receives the light, and becomes as enlightened
as light itself. (This passage is explained both in a physical
as well as spiritual sense. The light dispelling ignorance and
the gloom of nature).</p>

<p class='c009'>33. As the shining sun brings the lotus-buds to light, so
the light of the Divine Spirit, enlightens our intellects,
amidst the gloom of ignorance which envelopes them.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. And as the sun displays himself by making the day and night
by his rise and fall, so does the intellect show itself by its
development and reticence by turns.</p>

<p class='c009'>35. All our notions and ideas are contained in the particle
of the intellect, as a healthy seed contains the leaves and
fruits and flowers of the future tree in its breast.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. These and all the powers of the mind, develope themselves
in their proper times, as the fruits and flowers make their
appearance in spring and proper seasons—<i>khandas</i>. (The
Hindu festivals of Khanda pálás, are celebrated in honour of
the returning seasons, and continue as a relic of the
primitive agricultural state of society).</p>

<p class='c009'>37. The particle of divine spirit is altogether tasteless, being
so very vapid and void of qualities; yet it is always delectable
as the giver of flavour to all things. (The gloss explains the
spirit as spiritual knowledge, which is unpalatable to all, owing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>to its abstruse and subtile nature; but which becomes tasty
when blended with all other knowledge, which mainly depends
on spiritual science. This is in answer to “What particle is
that which is entirely tasteless, yet always tasted with zest?”).</p>

<p class='c009'>38. All savours abide in the waters (water being the receptacle
of taste), as a mirror is the recipient of a shadow; but the
savour like the shadow is not the substance; it is the essence
of the spirit that gives it the flavour. (The Nyáya says
“<i>jaleparamánurasah</i>” the atom of the spirit is the savour of the
water).</p>

<p class='c009'>39. All bodies existing in the world, are forsaken by the
atomic spirit of the supreme, by their unconsciousness of Him;
but they are dependant upon him, by the consciousness of the
divine particle, shining in their souls. (<i>i.e.</i> Consciousness is
the connecting link between the human and Divine souls). In
answer to “who are forsaken by and supported by the Divine
Spirit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>40. It is He who being unable to wrap up himself, enwraps
the world in him, by spreading out the vesture of his atomic
intellect over all existence. (In answer to “who being uncovered
himself covers the whole?”).</p>

<p class='c009'>41. The supreme Spirit which is of the form of infinite
space, cannot hide itself in any thing within its sphere,
which would be like the hiding of an elephant in the grass.</p>

<p class='c009'>42. Yet this all knowing spirit encompasses the world, knowing it
to be a trifle, just as a child holds a particle of rice in his
hand. This is an act of <i>máyá</i> or delusion. (Here delusion like
destiny is represented to exercise its influence on omniscience
itself).</p>

<p class='c009'>43. The spirit of God exists even after the dissolution of the
world, by relying in his <i>chit</i> or intellect; just as plants
survive the spring by the sap they have derived from it.</p>

<p class='c009'>44. It is the essence of the Intellect which gives rise to the
world, just as the garden continues to flourish by the nourishment
of the vernal season.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>45. Know the world is verily a transformation of the intellect,
and all its productions to be as plants in the great garden
of the world, nourished by the vernal juice of the intellect.</p>

<p class='c009'>46. It is the sap supplied by the intellectual particle, that
makes all things grow up with myriads of arms and eyes; in
the same manner as the atom of a seed, produces plants with
thousand branches and fruits. (In answer to “What formless
things take a thousand forms”).</p>

<p class='c009'>47. Myriads of kalpas amount to an infinitesimal part of a
twinkling of the atomic intellect, as a momentary dream presents
a man all the periods of his life from youth to age. In answer
to “What twinkling of the eye appears as many thousand
Kalpas &amp;c.”</p>

<p class='c009'>48. This infinitesimal of a twinkling even, is too long for
thousands of kalpas, the whole duration of existence is as
short as a flash of his eye.</p>

<p class='c009'>49. It is the idea only that makes a twinkling, appear a kalpa
or many, just as the idea of satiety in starvation, is a mere
delusion to the deluded soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>50. It is concupiscence only, that makes the famishing to
feed upon his thoughts of food; as it is the despair of one’s
life, that presents his death before him in his dream.</p>

<p class='c009'>51. All the worlds reside in the intellectual soul within the
atom of its intellect; and the outward worlds are only reflexions
(<i>réchauffé</i>) of the inner prototype. (The phenomenal is an ectype
of the original noumenal).</p>

<p class='c009'>52. Whatever object appears to be situated anywhere, it is
but a representation of its like model in some place or other,
and resembles the appearance of figures in bas-relief on any part
of a pillar; but the changes occurring in the external phenomena,
are no results of the internal, which as the serene vacuum is
subject to no change.</p>

<p class='c009'>53. All existences, which are present in the intellect at this
moment, are the same as they have existed, and will ever
exist inwardly like trees in their seeds.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>54. The atom of the intellect, contains the moments and ages
of time, like grains within the husk; it contains these (as its
contents) in the seed within the infinite soul of god. (The soul
is the unconscious container of the intellect, which is conscious
of the ideas contained in it).</p>

<p class='c009'>55. The soul remains quite aloof as if retired from the world
(udásína), notwithstanding the subsistence and dependence of
the latter upon the former. The Divine soul is unconcerned with
its creation and its sustentation at all times. (In answer to
“who is the cause of the world without any motive or causality
in him?” This is the doctrine of perfect bliss of the soul without
being ruffled or disturbed by any motivity or activity. So the
man imitating divine perfection, is required to be apathetic and
callous to all worldly affairs).</p>

<p class='c009'>56. The essence of the world springs from the atom of the pure
Intellect, which however remains apart from both the states
of action and passion itself (the intellect being the thinking
principle, has only its perceptivity, without sensitivity of
passion, or the Will or volition for action).</p>

<p class='c009'>57. There is nothing created or dissolved in the world by
any body at any time; all apparent changes are caused by the
delusion of our vision (and it is the province of Vedánta to
remove the error of conceiving the unreal worlds as a reality).</p>

<p class='c009'>58. (Viewed in its spiritual light), this world with all its
contents, is as void as the vault of the vacuous atmosphere; the
word world applied to the phenomena, is but an insignificant term
signifying a nothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>59. It is the particle of intellect that is led by the delusion
of <i>máyá</i>, to view the scenes situated in the Divine soul,
in the outward appearance of the phenomenal world. (Answer to
what thing that has eyes; views on its outside what is contained
in the soul?).</p>

<p class='c009'>60. The words external and internal as applied to the world,
are meaningless and not positive terms; there is no inside or
outside of the divine soul, they are contrived to explain its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>different views by the intellect for the instruction of pupils.
(Brahma has no inside nor outside. Sruti).</p>

<p class='c009'>61. The viewer looking into the invisible being within himself,
comes to see the soul; but he who looks on the outside with
his open eyes, comes to view the unreal as real.</p>

<p class='c009'>62. Therefore whoever looks into the soul (as the true
reality), can never view the false phenomena as realities
as others do.</p>

<p class='c009'>63. It is the internal sight of the intellect that looks into
the inward soul, which is without all desires; while the external
eyes are mere organs to look upon the false appearance of outward
objects. (<i>i.e.</i> The eye of the mind, is the true eye to
see the real nature of the soul; but the outer eyes are no eyes,
that feed only upon the falsities of nature).</p>

<p class='c009'>64. There can be no object of sight, unless there is a looker
also, as there can be no child without its parent. This duality
(of their mutual dependence upon one another), proceeds from
the want of knowledge of their unity. (<i>i.e.</i> The viewer, the view
and the vision (<i>drashtá</i>, <i>drishya</i> and <i>darsana</i>), being one and the
same thing, as the parent and the offspring, and the seed and
its sprout, are the same substance. The doctrine of the Vedantic
unity, thus attempts to reduce and unite all varieties to
their primitive simplicity).</p>

<p class='c009'>65. The viewer himself becomes the view as there can be no view
without its viewer. No body prepares any food, unless there
be some body to feed upon it. (It is the agent that makes the
act, as there can be no act without its agent).</p>

<p class='c009'>66. It is in the power of the intellect (imagination), to create
the views of its vision; as it lies in the capacity of gold, to
produce all the various forms of jewellery. (<i>i.e.</i> Fancy paints
and moulds itself in many colours and shapes. The creations
of phantasy are mere phantoms—<i>phantasia et phantasmos</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>67. The inanimate view never has nor can have the ability of
producing its viewer; as the golden bracelet has no power of
bringing the gold into being.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>68. The intellect having the faculty of intellection (chetana),
forms the thoughts of intelligibles (chetyas) within itself,
which however unreal are erroneously viewed as real entities
by its intellectual vision to its own deception, as it is
caused by the appearance of jewellery in gold.</p>

<p class='c009'>69. That the viewer (the divine intellect), being transformed
to the view (of the visible world), is no more perceptible in it,
than as the jewelery of gold and not gold itself. (<i>i.e.</i> The
formal part of the world and jewel, hides the material part of
the intellect and gold which formed them).</p>

<p class='c009'>70. Thus the viewer becoming the view (<i>i.e.</i> the subject
being turned to the object), still views himself as the viewer;
as gold transformed to a jewel, is always looked upon as gold.</p>

<p class='c009'>71. One unity alone being apparent in all nature, it is useless
to talk of the duality of the viewer and view. A word with a
masculine affix cannot give the sense of a neuter noun (so the
masculine noun <i>Intellectus</i>, cannot apply to the neuter
<i>phenomenon</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>72. The viewer who feasts his eyes with a view of the outer
visible world, cannot have the sight of the inner soul with
the internal eyes of his intellect; but when the viewer shuts
out the outer view, all its realities appear as unreal.</p>

<p class='c009'>73. When the viewer perceives the unreality of the visibles by
the light of his understanding, he then comes to see the true
reality. So by retracting the mind from viewing the figure of
the jewel, one comes to see the nature of its gold only.</p>

<p class='c009'>74. The visibles being present, there must be their viewers
also to whose view they are apparent. It is the absence of both
(the viewer and the view), and the knowledge of their unreality,
that produce the belief of unity. (The disappearance of the
visible, causes the withdrawal of the viewer; like the removal
of the umbrella, drives away its shade).</p>

<p class='c009'>75. The man who considers all things in the contriteness of his
conscious soul, comes at last to perceive something in him,
which is serenely clear, and which no words can express.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>76. The minute particle of the intellect, shows us the sight
of the soul as clearly as a lamp enlightens everything in the
dark. (Answer to “who shows the soul as clearly as a visible
thing”?)</p>

<p class='c009'>77. The intelligent soul is absolved of its perceptions of the
measure, measurer and measurables, (<i>i.e.</i> of the forms and
properties of things), as liquid gold when dissolved of its form of
an ornament. (Answer to “what thing is absolved of its properties
like gold of its jewellery”).</p>

<p class='c009'>78. As there is nothing which is not composed of the elementary
bodies of earth, water &amp;c.; so there is nothing in nature
which is apart from the nature of the atomic intellect. (Answer
to “what is that from which nothing is apart?”).</p>

<p class='c009'>79. The thinking soul penetrates into all things in the form
of their notions; and because all thoughts concentrate in the
intellect, there is nothing apart from it.</p>

<p class='c009'>80. Our desires being the parents of our wished for objects,
they are the same with our prospects in our view: therefore
there is no difference between our desires and desired objects;
as there is none between the sea and its waves. (In refutation
of the question, “what is that which is distinct from the wish?”).</p>

<p class='c009'>81. The Supreme Soul exists alone unbounded by time and space.
Being the universal soul, it is the soul of all; and being
omniscient, it is no dull matter at all. (Answer to “what
is the undivided duality and plurality?”).</p>

<p class='c009'>82. The <i>Ens</i> being but intelligence, is not perceptible to
sight; there is unity and no duality in it; but all forms unite
into one in the great self of the Supreme.</p>

<p class='c009'>83. If there be a duality, it is the one and its unity. The
unity and duality of the universal soul, are both as true as
the light and its shade joined together.</p>

<p class='c009'>84. Where there is no duality or any number above it, there
unity also can have no application to any; and where there is
no unit, there cannot be any two or more over it, which are but
repetitions of the unit (except an indeterminate all or whole).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>85. Anything which is so situated, is in itself such as it is; it
cannot be more or less than itself; but is identic with itself
like water and its fluidity. (Its plurality is but a repeated
unity).</p>

<p class='c009'>86. The multiplicity of forms which it exhibits, blends into
a harmonic whole without conflicting with one another. The
multifarious creation is contained in Brahma, like a tree with
all its several parts in the embryonic seed.</p>

<p class='c009'>87. Its dualism is as inseparable from it as the bracelet from
its gold; and although multiformity of nature, is evident to the
comprehensive understanding; yet it is not true of the true
entity (of God).</p>

<p class='c009'>88. Like fluidity of water, fluctuation of air, vacuity of
the sky, is this multiformity an inseparable property of the
Godhead.</p>

<p class='c009'>89. Disquisition of unity and duality is the cause of misery to
the restless spirit, it is the want of this distinction that
consummates the highest knowledge.</p>

<p class='c009'>90. The measure, measurement and measurer of all things,
and the viewer, view and vision of the visible world, are all
dependent on the atom of the intellect which contains them all.
(<i>i.e.</i> The divine mind is the maker and pattern of the great
fabric of the universe, which it contains and views in itself).</p>

<p class='c009'>91. The atom of the divine intellect, spreads out and contracts
in itself, like its limbs, these mountainous orbs of the world,
by an inflation of its spirit as it were by a breath of air.</p>

<p class='c009'>92. O the wonder, and the great wonder of wonders! that this
atom of the intellect, should contain in its embryo, all the
three regions of the worlds, above and below one another.</p>

<p class='c009'>93. O! it is an incredible delusion that must ever remain an
inexplicable riddle, how the monstrous universe is contained
in the minute atom of the Intellect.</p>

<p class='c009'>94. As a pot contains in it, the seed, with a huge tree within its
cell, so does the divine soul contain the atom of the intellect,
containing the chains of worlds (outstretched within itself).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>95. The all-seeing eye sees at once all the worlds, situated
within the bosom of the intellect, as the microscopic sight
discovers the parts of the future tree concealed in the seed.</p>

<p class='c009'>96. The expansion of the world in the atom of the Intellect,
is analogous to the enlargement of the hidden parts of the
seed, into leaves and branches, fruits and flowers.</p>

<p class='c009'>97. As the multiformity of the future tree, is contained in the
uniform substance within the seed; it is in like manner that the
multiplicity of worlds, is situated in the unity of the atomic
Intellect, and as such it is seen by any one who will but look
into it.</p>

<p class='c009'>98. It is neither an unity nor a duality, not the seed or its
sprout, neither is it thin or thick, nor is born nor unborn
(but ever the same as it is).</p>

<p class='c009'>99. He is neither an entity nor nonentity, nor graceful nor
ungraceful (but a vacuity); and though it contains the three
worlds with the ether and air, yet is nothing and no substance
at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>100. There is no world nor a not-world beside the intellect,
which is all of itself, and is said to be such and such in any
place or time, as it appears so and so to us there and then.</p>

<p class='c009'>101. It rises as if unrisen, and expands in its own knowledge;
it is selfsame with the supreme soul, and as the totality of all
selves, it spreads through the whole vacuum as air.</p>

<p class='c009'>102. As a tree springs from the ground according to its seed,
so the world appears to sight in the form, as it is contained
in the seed of the intellect.</p>

<p class='c009'>103. The plant does not quickly quit its seed, lest it would
be dried up and die away for want of its sap; so the man that
sticks to the soul and seed of his being, is free from disease
and death.</p>

<p class='c009'>104. The mount Meru is like the filament of a flower, in
respect to the vastness of that atom; all visibles have
their place in that invisible atom. (In answer to the question,
in respect to whom is the great Meru but a filament?)</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>105. The Meru is verily a filament of the atomic flower of
the divine soul; and myriads of Merus resemble the cloudy
spots, rising in the sphere of the intellect.</p>

<p class='c009'>106. It is that one great atom that fills the world, after
having made it out of itself; and given it a visible, extended
and material form in its own hollow sphere. (Answer to “By whom
is the world created, extended &amp;c.”).</p>

<p class='c009'>107. As long as the knowledge of duality is not driven out of
the mind, so long does it find the charming form of the world,
as in its dream upon waking. But the knowledge of unity,
liberates the soul from its stay in and return to the world,
which it beholds as a mass of the divine essence.</p>

Argument. The Rákshasí’s account of herself,

</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> continued:—The apish Karkatí of the forest, having
heard the speech of the prince, pondered well in herself the
sense of the words, and forsook her levity and malice.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. She found the coolness and tranquility of her heart after its
fervour was over; in the manner of the peacock at the setting
in of the rains, and the lotus bed at the rising of moonbeams.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. The words of the prince delighted her heart in the same
manner, as the cries of cranes flying in the sky, gladden the
passing clouds in the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. The Rákshasí said:—O how brightly shines the pure light
of your understanding, it glows as serenely by its inward
effulgence, as it is illuminated by the sun of intelligence.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Hearing the grains (words) of your reasoning, my heart is
as gladdened, as when the earth is cooled by the serene beams
of the humid moon-light.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Reasonable men like yourself are honoured and venerated in
the world, and I am as delighted in your company, as a lake
of lotuses with her full blown buds under the moon-beams.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. The society of the virtuous, scatters its blessings, as a
flower garden spreads its fragrance all around; and as the
brightness of sun-beams, brings the lotus buds to bloom.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Society with the good and great, dispels all our woes; as
a lamp in the hand, disperses the surrounding darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. I have fortunately obtained you as two great lights in
this forest; you both are entitled to my reverence here,
and deign now to acquaint me, with the good intent which
has brought you hither.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>10. The prince answered:—O thou sprout of the savage race of
Rákshas! the people of this province are always afflicted in
their hearts by a certain evil.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. It is the obdurate disease of Vishuchi or cholic pain,
which troubles the people of this part, I have therefore come
out with my guards to find her out in my nightly rounds.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. This cholic pain is not removed from the hearts of men
by any medicine, so I have come out in search of the mantra
revealed to her for its cure.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. It is my business and professed duty, to persecute such
wicked beings as thyself, that infest our ignorant subjects
in this manner, and this is all that I have to tell thee and
do in this place.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. Therefore, O good lady! do thou promise to me in thy
own words, that thou shalt never injure any living being
in future.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. The Rákshasí replied:—Well! I tell thee in truth, my
lord! that I shall hence forward never kill any body.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. The prince replied:—If it be so O thou liver on animal
flesh! tell me how shalt thou support thy body by thy
abstaining from animal food?</p>

<p class='c009'>17. The Rákshasí replied:—It is now passed six months,
O prince! that I have risen from my entranced meditation, and
fostered my desire for food, which I wholly renounce today.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. I will again repair to the mountain top, and betake
myself to my steadfast meditation, and sit there contented
as long as I like, in the posture of an unmoving statue.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. I will restrain myself by unshaken meditation until
my death, and then I shall quit this body in its time
with gladness. This is my resolution.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. I tell you now, O prince! that until the end of this
life and body of mine, I shall no more take away the life of
any living being, and you may rely assured upon my word.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. There is the mount Himalaya by name, standing in the
heart of the northern region, and stretching in one sweep,
from the eastern to western main.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>22. There had I dwelt at first in a cave of its golden peak,
in the shape of an iron statue, and also as the fragment of a
cloud, and borne the appellation of Karkatí the Rákshasí:—(the
crablike crooked Sycorax).</p>

<p class='c009'>23. There I obtained the sight of Brahmá by the austerity
of my devotion; and expressed my desire of killing mankind,
in the shape of a destructive needle.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. I obtained the boon accordingly, and passed a great many
years in the act of afflicting living brings, and feeding upon
their entrails in the form of the cholic pain.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. I was then prohibited by Brahmá to kill the learned,
and was instructed in the great mantra for my observance.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. He then gave me the power of piercing the hearts of
men, with some other diseases which infest all mankind.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. I spread myself far and wide in my malice, and sucked
the heart blood of men, which dried up their veins and
arteries; and emaciated their bodies.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. Those whom I left alive after devouring their flesh and
blood, they begat a race as lean and veinless as they had
become themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>29. You will be successful O happy prince in getting the <i>mantra</i>
or charm for driving the Visúchiká pain; because there is
nothing impossible of attainment by the wise and strong.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. Receive of me immediately, O raja! the <i>mantra</i> which
has been uttered by Brahmá for removal of the cholic pain,
from the cells of arteries vitiated by <i>Visúchiká</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. Now advance towards me, and let us go to the neighbouring
river; and there initiate you with the mantra, after you both
are prepared to receive it by your ablution and purification.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. Vasishtha said:—Then the Rákshasí proceeded to the
river side that very night, accompanied by the prince
and his minister, and all joining together as friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. These being sure of the amity of the Rákshasí both by
affirmative and negative proofs, made their ablutions and
stood on the bank on the river.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>34. The Rákshasí then communicated to them with tenderness, the
effective <i>mantra</i> which was revealed to her by Brahmá, for the
removal of Visúchiká pain, and which was always successful.</p>

<p class='c009'>35. Afterwards as the nocturnal fiend was about to depart by
leaving her friendly companions behind, the prince stopped
her course with his speech.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. The prince said:—O thou of gigantic stature! thou hast
become our preceptor by thy teaching us the <i>mantra</i>, we invite
thee with affection, to take thy repast with us at ours tonight.</p>

<p class='c009'>37. It does not become thee to break off our friendship,
which has grown like the acquaintance of good people, at
our very first meeting.</p>

<p class='c009'>38. Give thy illfavoured feature a little more graceful
figure, and walk along with us to our abode, and there
reside at thy own pleasure.</p>

<p class='c009'>39. The Rákshasí replied:—You can well provide a female of
your own kind with her proper food; but what entertainment
can you give to my satisfaction, who am a cannibal by my
nature!</p>

<p class='c009'>40. It is the food of a giant (Rákshasa) alone, that can yield
me satisfaction, and not the little morsel of petty mortals;
this is the innate nature of our being, and can not be done
away with as long as we carry with us our present bodies.</p>

<p class='c009'>41. The prince answered:—Ornamented with necklaces of gold,
you shall be at liberty to remain with the ladies in my
house, for as many days as you may like to abide.</p>

<p class='c009'>42. I will then manage to produce for your food, the robbers
and felons that I will seize in my territories; and you will have
them supplied to you by hundreds and thousands at all times.</p>

<p class='c009'>43. You can then forsake your comely form, and assume
thy hideous figure of the Rákshasí, and kill and take
to your food hundreds of those lawless men.</p>

<p class='c009'>44. Take them to the top of the snowy mountain and devour
them at thy pleasure; as great men always like to take
their meals in privacy.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>45. After your recreation by that food and a short nap,
you can join your meditation; and when you are tired with
your devotion, you can come back to this place.</p>

<p class='c009'>46. You can then take the other offenders for your slaughter;
because the killing of culprits is not only justifiable by
law, but it amounts to an act of mercy, to rid them (of their
punishment in the next world).</p>

<p class='c009'>47. You must return to me when you are tired of your
devotion; because the friendship which is formed even
with the wicked, is not easily done away.</p>

<p class='c009'>48. The Rákshasí replied:—You have well said prince! and we
will do as you say; for who is there that will slight the words
of the wise that are spoken to him in the way of friendship?</p>

<p class='c009'>49. Vasishtha said:—Saying so, the Rákshasí assumed a
graceful form, and wore on her person necklaces and
bracelets, and silken robes and laces.</p>

<p class='c009'>50. She said, “Well raja, let us go together” and then
followed the footsteps of the prince and his counsellor,
who walked before her and led the way.</p>

<p class='c009'>51. Then having arrived at the royal abode, they passed that
night in their agreeable repast and discourse together.</p>

<p class='c009'>52. As it became morning, the Rákshasí went inside the
house, and there remained with the women; while the
prince and the minister attended to their business.</p>

<p class='c009'>53. Then in the course of six days, the prince collected
together all the offenders whom he had seized in his
territory, and brought from other parts.</p>

<p class='c009'>54. These amounted to three thousand heads which he gave
up to her; when she resumed her fiercely dark form of
the black fiend of night.</p>

<p class='c009'>55. She laid hold of thousands of men in her extended grasp,
in the manner of a fragment of cloud retaining the drops of
rain water in its wide spread bosom.</p>

<p class='c009'>56. She took leave of the prince and went to the top of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>mountain with her prey, as a poor man takes the gold, that he
happens to get in some hidden place.</p>

<p class='c009'>57. There she refreshed herself with her food and rest for
three days and nights; and then regaining the firmness of her
under-standing, she was employed in her devotion.</p>

<p class='c009'>58. She used to rise from her devotion once after the lapse
of four or five and sometimes seven years, when she repaired to
the habitation of men and to the court of the prince.</p>

<p class='c009'>59. There passing sometime in their confidential conversation,
she returned to her retired seat in the mountain, with her
prey of the offenders.</p>

<p class='c009'>60. Thus freed from cares even in her lifetime, she continued
to remain as a liberated being in that mountain &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. Deification and Adoration of the
Rákshasí for her good Services to Mankind.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> continued:—The Rákshasí thus continued in her
devotion, and remained on friendly terms with the successive
rulers of the Kiráta country, who kept supplying her with her
rations. (The Rákshasí maneater was turned to Rákshiní or
preserver of men).
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. She continued by the power of her perfection in the practice
of yoga meditation, to prevent all portents, to ward off
all dread and danger of demons, and remove the diseases of the
people. (All these were done by the Rákshasí vidyá now lost,
and by supernatural powers gained by yoga).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. In the course of many years of her meditation, she used
to come out of her cell at certain intervals, and call at the head
quarters, for her capture of the collection of living creatures
kept for her victims. (Man slaughter was not blamable on the
part of the cannibal Rákshasí, though practising the yoga; nor
was the eating of animal flesh reprehensible in Vasishtha himself,
who had been a flesh eating yogi. (See Uttara Ráma Charita)).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. The practice continues still to be observed by the princes
of the place, who conduct the animals to be sacrificed to her
departed ghost on the hill; as none can be negligent to repay
the good services of his benefactor. (Hence the prevalence of
the practice of offering sacrifices to the names of ancestors and
deified heroes and heroines, and even of demons for their past
good services).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. At last she became defunct in her meditation, and ceased
since long to appear to the habitations of men, and lend her
aid in removing their diseases, dangers and difficulties. (The
good genius of the place left it at last).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>6. The people then dedicated a high temple to her memory, and
placed in it a statue of hers, under the title of Kandará—caverner
<i>alias</i> Mangalá deví—the auspicious goddess. (The whole
legend of the Kandará of Kirátas, alludes to the account of
Mangalá Chandí <i>alias</i> Kalika deví—the black and voracious
goddess of the Hindus).</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Since then it is the custom of the chiefs of the tribe, to
consecrate a newly made statue in honor of the Kandará deví—the
goddess of the valley, after the former one is disfigured and
dilapidated. (The Kirántis are said to continue in their idolatry
to this day, notwithstanding the conversion of their fellow
hill tribes to Mahomedanism, except the Kafers—another hill
tribe of the Himalayas who are idolators still).</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Any prince of the place, who out of his vileness, fails to
consecrate the statue of the Kandará goddess, brings out of his
own perverseness, great calamities to visit his people. (This
sort of retributive justice is expressed in the adage “rájadoshat
rájya nashta”:—“And for the king’s offence the people died.”
Pope’s Homer’s Iliad I).</p>

<p class='c009'>9. By worshipping her, man obtains the fruits of all his
desires; and by neglecting it, he exposes himself to all sorts of
evils and calamities; as effects of the pleasure and displeasure
of the goddess to her votaries or otherwise. (The two clauses
are instances of affirmative and negative enthymemes coupled
together as <i>anvaya vyatirekí</i>. The first enthymeme of the
antecedent and consequent is affirmative <i>anvayí</i>, and the
other a <i>vyatirekí</i> or negative one). Gloss.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. The goddess is still worshipped by dying and ailing people
with offerings, for remedy of their illness and securing her
blessings; and she in her turn distributes her rewards among
them, that worship her either in her statue or picture. (Raxá
Kálí is worshipped in statue, but Mongla Chandí is worshipped
in a <i>ghata</i> or potful of water).</p>

<p class='c009'>11. She is the bestower of all blessings to young babes, and
weak calves and cows; while she kills the hardy and proud that
deserve their death. She is the goddess of intelligence and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>favours the intelligent, and presides for ever in the realm of
the Kiráta people. (Vasishtha being a theist, reviles like a
Vaishnava, the black goddess as a Rákshasí, which a Kaula
cannot countenance).</p>

Argument. Reason of the application of the
name Karkatí, and its simile to a crooked crab.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> said:—I have thus related to you Ráma, the unblamable
legend of Karkatí, the Rákshasí of Imaus, from its beginning
to end <i>in ipso facto</i>. (Imaus and Imodus are ranges of
the Himálayas. The Gloss interprets Imaus as a synonym of
Himálayas, by apocope of the latter member of the compound
word, and by a grammatical rule, that the curtailing of a part of
a proper name, does not affect the full meaning of the name. So
for the omissions of agnomens and cognomens).
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Ráma rejoined:—But how could one born in a cave of
Himavatas (Imodus), become a black Rákshasí, and why was
she called Karkatí? These I want to be clearly explained to
me. (Ráma’s demand was reasonable, as the people of the
Himálayas, are always of fair complexions, and the Rákshasas
were the Negroes of Southern India).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Vasishtha replied:—The Rakshas (cannibals), are originally
of many races, some of whom are of dark and others of fair
complexions, while many have a yellowish appearance and
some of a greenish shade. (We know the red Rákshasas of
America, but it is impossible for us to account for the
green or blue Rákshasas in the text).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. As for Karkatí, you must know that there was a Rákshasa
by name of Karkata, from his exact resemblance to a cancer.
(Here is a reversion of Sycorax the Negro parent, and her crooked
son caliban Kálibán—the black Negro, having long arms and
legs, with feet and hands furnished with claws and long nails
like those of beasts).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. The reason of my relating to you the narrative of Karkatí,
was only for her queries which I recollected and thought, would
serve well to explain the omniform God, in our disquisition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>into spiritual knowledge. (Gloss. Vasishtha adduces a contradiction
in the spiritual knowledge of God, by calling him a spirit
and yet as all forms of things. But this seeming contrariety
will disappear upon reflecting that, the phenomenal is contained
in the noumenal, and the forms are viewed only in the spirit as
visions in dreams).</p>

<p class='c009'>6. It is evident that the pure and perfect unity, is the
source of the impure and imperfect duality of the phenomena,
and this finite world has sprung from its Supreme cause, who
is without beginning and end. (The One is the cause of many,
and the Infinite is the source of the finite. Ahamsarvasyám.
Anádirádi sarvasya).</p>

<p class='c009'>7. These float (before our eyes) like the waves upon waters,
which are apparently of different forms, and yet essentially
the same with the element, on which they seem to move. So the
creations whether present, past or future, are all situated in the
Supreme Spirit. (The immaterial spirit is the basis and substratum
of material bodies).</p>

<p class='c009'>8. As wet wood when ignited, serves for the purpose of infusing
heat, and inviting the apes of the forest to warm themselves
in cold weather; so the externally shining appearance of
the world, invites the ignorant to resort to it.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. Such is the temporary glow of the ever cool spirit of God,
in the works of creation; which shows itself in many forms
without changing its essence.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. The absent world appeared in presence, and its unreality
appears as a reality to consciousness, like the potential figures
carved in wood. (The would-be world existed in the eternal
ideas in the mind of God, like the possible figures in the wood,
which were carved out afterwards. And so too Aristotle).</p>

<p class='c009'>11. As the products, of the seed from its sprout to the fruit, are
all of the same species; so the thoughts (chetyas) of the mind—Chitta,
are of the same nature as those originally implanted in
it. (The homogeneity of the cause with all its effects).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. By the law of the continuity of the same essence, there
is no difference in the nature of the seed and its fruit; so the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>intellect (chit) and the thoughts (chetyas), differ in nothing except
in their forms; like the waves and water differing in external
appearance, and not in the intrinsicality of their substance (Vastu).</p>

<p class='c009'>13. No demonstration can show the difference between thoughts
and the mind; and whatever distinction our judgment may make
betwixt them, it is easily refuted by right reasoning. (Such
as the incapability of an effect being produced without its
cause, or disagreement between the effects of the same or
similar causes).</p>

<p class='c009'>14. Let this error therefore vanish, as it has come from nothing
to nothing; and as all causeless falsities fail of themselves.
You will know more of this, Ráma! when you are awakened to
divine knowledge. In the meantime, do away with error of
viewing a duality, which is different from the only existent Unity.
(Duality being driven out, all will appear one and the same.
So Sádi the sophist: <i>duirácho badar kardam ekebinam ekedámam</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>15. After the knot of your error is cut asunder, by your
attending to my lectures, you will come to know by yourself,
the signification and substance (object) of what is called
the true knowledge, which is taken in different senses by
the various schools; but that which comes of itself in the
mind, is the intuitive knowledge of divine truth.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. You have a mind like that of the common people (itara),
which is full of mistakes and blunders (anarthas); all which
will doubtlessly subside in your mind, by your attending to my
lectures (because the words of the wise remove all errors).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. You will be awakened by my sermons to know this
certain truth, that all things proceed from Brahma into whom
they ultimately return. (Brahma is the producer, sustainer, and
recipient or the first and last of all. He is alpha and omega).</p>

<p class='c009'>18. Ráma rejoined:—Sir, your affirmation of the first cause
in the ablative case, “that all things proceed from Brahma,” is
opposed to the negative passage in the Sruti in the same case,
that “nothing is distinct from Him”; and is inconsistent in
itself (in as much as, there cannot be all things, and again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>nothing but Brahma; and to say “the same thing comes from
the same,” would be a palpable absurdity).</p>

<p class='c009'>19. Vasishtha answered:—Words or significant terms are
used in the Sástras for instruction of others; and where there
appears any ambiguity in them, they are explained in their
definitions. (Hence the ablative form “from Brahma” is not
faulty, for what is in the receptacle, the same comes out of it; or
as they say, “what is in the bottom, the same comes upon the
surface”; and the one is not distinct from the other, as the wave
differs not from the water whence it rises. This is downright
pantheism).</p>

<p class='c009'>20. Hence it is the use though not in honest truth, to make
a difference of the visibles from the invisible Brahma (for the
purpose of instruction); as it is usual to speak of ghosts appearing
to children, though there be no such things in reality. (It
is imagination that gives a name to airy nothing, and it is the
devise of language to use words for negative ideas, as the word
world to denote a duality and darkness for want of light, and not
anything in itself).</p>

<p class='c009'>21. In reality there is no duality connected with the unity
of Brahma, as there is no dualism of a city and the dream that
shows its apparition in sleep. Again God being immutable in
his nature and eternal decree, it is wrong to apply the mutations
of nature and the mutability of Will to Him. (Volition is
accompanied by nolition (<i>Volo and nolo</i>) in mutable minds, but
there is no option <i>Vikalpa</i> in the <i>sankalpa—suo arbitrio</i> of the
unchangeable Mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. The Lord is free from the states of causality and the
caused, of instrumentality and instruments, of a whole and its
part, and those of proprietorship and property. (The attribution
of cause and effect or any other predicate or predicable, is
wholly inapplicable to him, who is devoid of all attributes).</p>

<p class='c009'>23. He is beyond all affirmative and negative propositions, and
their legitimate conclusions or false deductions and elenches.
(<i>i.e.</i> Nothing can be truly affirmed or denied or ascertained
or negated
of Him, by any mode of reasoning. <i>Naisatarkenánaneyah</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>24. So the attribution, of the primary volition to the Deity, is a
false imputation also. Yet it is usual to say so for the instruction
of the ignorant; though there is no change in his nature from
its nolliety to velleity. (So it is usual to attribute sensible
properties of speech and sight, to the immaterial spirit of
God, by a figure of speech; and for the instruction of the
vulgar, who cannot comprehend the incomprehensible).</p>

<p class='c009'>25. These sensible terms and figurative expressions, are used
for the guidance of the ignorant; but the knowing few, are
far from falling into the fallacy of dualism. All sensible
conceptions ceasing upon the spiritual perception of God,
there ensues an utter and dumb silence. (We become tongue-tied,
and our lips are closed and sealed in silence, to speak anything
with certainty of the unspeakable).</p>

<p class='c009'>26. When in time you come to know these things better, you
shall arrive at the conclusion, that all this is but one thing,
and an undivided whole without its parts, and having no beginning
nor end. (The world is therefore self-same and co-eternal
and co-existent, with the eternal and self-existent God).</p>

<p class='c009'>27. The unlearned dispute among themselves from their
uncertainty of truth; but their differences and dualisms are all
at an end, upon their arriving to the knowledge of the true
unity by instructions of the wise. (The reality is precisely in
the indifference of the subject and object. Schelling).</p>

<p class='c009'>28. Without knowledge of the agreement of significant words
with their significates, it is impossible to know the Unity,
for so long as a word is taken in different senses, there will be
no end of disputes and difference of opinions. Dualisms being
done away, all disputes are hushed up in the belief of unity.
(<i>i.e.</i> All words expressive of the Deity, refer to his
unity and signify the one and the same Lord of all, which ends
all controversy on the point).</p>

<p class='c009'>29. O support of Raghu’s race! place your reliance on the
sense of the great sayings of the vedas; and without paying any
regard to discordant passages, attend to what I will tell you at
present. (Such as: Brahma is used in one place in the ablative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>and in another in the locative case, and also in the nominative
and as the same with the world).</p>

<p class='c009'>30. From whatever cause it may have sprung, the world resembles
a city rising to view in a vision; just as the thoughts
and ideas appearing before the mirror of the mind, from some
source of which we know nothing. (They are as puppet shows
of the player, behind the screen).</p>

<p class='c009'>31. Hear Ráma! and I will relate to you an instance for your
ocular evidence, how the mind (chitta), spins out the magical
world (máyika) from itself. (This ocular instance called the
<i>drishtánta-drishtávedana</i>, is that of the spider’s thread
(urnanábha-tantu) woven of itself, and given in the Sruti).</p>

<p class='c009'>32. Having known this, O Ráma! you will be able to cast away all
your erroneous conceptions; and being certain of the certitude,
you will resign your attachment to, and your desires in this
enchanted and bewitching world. (Hence the certainty, of God’s
being aloof from the false world, as it is said <i>Deus ex machina</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>33. All these prospective worlds are machinations or the
working of the mind. Having forsaken these false fabrications of
fancy, you will have the tranquility of your soul, and abide in
peace with yourself for ever. (Exemption from all worldly cares
and anxieties of the past, present and future lives, leads to the
peace of mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>34. By paying your attention to the drift of my preachings,
you will be able to find out of your own reasoning, a mite of
the medicine, for curing all the maladies of your deluded mind.
(Right reason by the art of reasoning, furnishes the true medicine
(psyches iatrion) to remove the errors of the understanding).</p>

<p class='c009'>35. If you sit in this manner (in your silent meditation),
you will see the whole world in your mind; and all outward
bodies will disappear (in your abstract contemplation), like
drops of oil in the sand. (All things are presented to the
mind by intuition, and are present in the memory—the great
keeper or master of Rolls of the soul).</p>

<p class='c009'>36. The mind is the seat of the universe as long as it is not
vitiated by passions and affections and afflictions of life;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>and it is set beyond the world (in heavenly bliss), no sooner it
gets rid of the turmoils of its present state. (The mind, says
Milton, can make a heaven of hell and a hell of heaven).</p>

<p class='c009'>37. The mind is the means to accomplish anything; it is the
store-keeper to preserve all things in the store-house of its
memory; it is the faculty of reasoning; and the power to act
like a respectable person. It is therefore to be treated with
respect, in recalling, restraining and guiding us to our pursuits
and duties. (<i>Facultates sunt quibus facilius fit, sine quibus
omnino confici non potest.</i> Cicero).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The mind is what moves and acts by its active and
cognitive faculties, and is more to be regarded than the body,
which move entirely as it is moved by the mind. Hence God
is called the Mind of the world—<i>Anima mundi</i>?</p>

<p class='c009'>38. The mind contains the three worlds with all their contents,
and the surrounding air in itself; and exhibits itself as the
plenum of egoism, and plenitude of all in its microcosm. (The
mind is the synthesis of all its attributes, and man is living
synthesis of the world with regard to his mind. Paracelsus.
Its memory is both a capacity and a power by its retention and
ready reproduction of every thing).</p>

<p class='c009'>39. The intellectual part of the mind, contains the subjective
self-consciousness of <i>ego</i>, which is the seed of all its powers;
while its other or objective part, bears the erroneous forms of the
dull material world in itself. (The former is called the <i>drashtá</i>
or viewer <i>ego</i>, and the latter the <i>drishta</i> or the view <i>non ego</i>. The
subjective is the thinking subject <i>ego</i>, and the objective
is the object of thought the <i>non ego</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>40. The self-born Brahmá saw the yet increate and formless world,
as already present before his mind in its ideal state, like a
dream at its first creation. He saw it (mentally) without seeing
it (actually). (<i>i.e.</i> The eternal ideas of immaterial forms of
possible things in the Divine Mind. The eternal exemplars of
things and Archetypes of the Ectypal world. Thus the
passage in the Bible “And God saw his works were good.” <i>i.e.</i>
answer those in his fair idea. Milton).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>41. He beheld the whole creation in the self-consciousness
(samvitti) of his vast mind, and he saw the material objects, the
hills &amp;c., in the <i>samvid</i> of his gross personal consciousness.
At last he perceived by his <i>súkshma vid</i> subtile sightedness
(clairvoyance), that all gross bodies were as empty as air and not
solid substantialities. (Consciousness being the joint knowledge
of the subjective and objective, <i>i.e.</i> of ourselves in connection
with others; the one is called superior or subjective self-consciousness,
and the other or objective personal-consciousness).<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c010'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>42. The mind with its embodying thoughts, is pervaded by the
omnipresent soul, which is spread out as transpicuously as
sun-beams upon the limpid water. (The soul is the <i>chit</i> or
intellectual part of the mind (chitbhága of chitta), and the root
of all mental activities. The <i>chidbhága</i> has the power of giving
knowledge which moves the other faculties of the mind. Gloss).</p>

<p class='c009'>43. The mind is otherwise like an infant, which views the
apparition of the world in its insensible sleep of ignorance; but
being awakened by the intellect chit, it sees the transcendent
form of the self or soul without the mist of delusion, which is
caused by the sensitive part of the mind, and removed by the
reasoning faculties of the intellect—Chidbhága.</p>

<p class='c009'>44. Hear now Ráma! what I am going to tell of the manner,
in which the soul is to be seen in this phenomenal world,
which is the cause of misleading the mind from its knowledge
of the unity to the erroneous notion of the duality. (The
sensitivity of the mind of objective phenomenals, misleads
it from its intellection of the subjective noumenal part
which is a positive unity. Gloss).</p>

<p class='c009'>45. What I will say, can not fail to come to your heart, by the
opposite similes, right reasoning, and graceful style, and good
sense of the words, in which they shall be conveyed to you; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>by hearing of these, your heart will be filled with delight, which
will pervade your senses, like the pervasive oil upon the water.</p>

<p class='c009'>46. The speech which is without suitable comparisons and
graceful phraseology, which is inaudible or clamorous, and has
inappropriate words and harsh sounding letters, cannot take
possession of the heart, but is thrown away for nothing, like
butter poured upon the burnt ashes of an oblation, and has no
power to kindle the flame.</p>

<p class='c009'>
The blemishes of speech are all comprised in the following
couplet in the Mahábháshya of Patánjala:—ग्रस्तं निरस्तं प्रबिलम्वितं द्रुतमीम्वु कूतं ध्मानमथबिकम्पितं ।
बिस्रस्तमेणी कृतमङ्गकं हतं बिकीर्ण मेताष्ठस्वरदोषभाबनाः ॥
</p>

<p class='c009'>47. Whatever narrative and tales there are in any language
on earth, and whatever compositions are adorned with measured
sentences and graceful diction; all these are rendered perspicacious
by conspicuous comparisons, as the world is enlightened by the
cooling beams of the moon. Hence every sloka almost in this work,
is embellished with a suitable comparison.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXXXV.<br> <br><span class="smcap">Interview of Brahmá and the Sun.</span><br></h2>
</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument.—Brahmá intending to create the world, sees
the orbs of light, and invokes the luminous Sun.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> continued:—I will relate to you Ráma, agreeably to your
request, the story that was narrated to me of old by Brahmá himself
(the personified mind of God and the lord of creatures). The <i>manas</i>
or mind produced <i>Manu</i>—the progeny of the mind; who begat the
<i>Manujas</i> otherwise called <i>mánavas or manushyas</i>, or men—the
offspring of the mind.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. I had asked the lotus-born god once before, to tell me
how these hosts of creation had come to being. (Vasishtha the
offspring of Brahmá, had his communion with his father—the
first great patriarch of mankind).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Then Brahmá the great progenitor of men, granted my request,
and related to me the apologue of Aindava in his sonorous
voice. (The oracles of God were delivered in the loud noise
of thunders—<i>brihad-vachas</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Brahmá said:—All this visible world is the manifestation
of the divine mind, like the circling whirl-pools and
rippling curls of water on the surface of the sea. (Referring
to the revolutions of heavenly bodies in the air).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Hear me tell you, said he, how I (the personified mind),
awoke at first on the day of creation in a former kalpa, with
my volition to create (expand) myself. (The volitive mind
rose out of the sleeping intelligence on the dawning day of
creation).</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Erewhile I remained alone, and quietly intent upon the One
at the end of the prior day (or Kalpa), by having compressed
the whole creation in the focus of my mind, and hid it under
the gloom of the primeval night. (Old chaos or darkness that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>reigned over the surface of the deep before the dawn of light.
<i>Tama ásit, tamaságúdhamagra.</i> There was darkness enveloping
all things. Sruti).</p>

<p class='c009'>7. At the end of the chaotic night I awoke as from a deep
sleep; and performed my matins as it is the general law (of all
living beings). I oped my eyes with a view to create, and fixed
my look on the vacuum all about me.</p>

<p class='c009'>(When that spirit sleeps it is night, and when it awakes, it
is a day of recreation (resurrection). Manu).</p>

<p class='c009'>8. As far as I viewed, it was empty space and covered by
darkness, and there was no light of heaven. It was unlimitedly
extensive, all void and without any boundary. (Infinite space
existed ere creation came into existence. Sruti. All was <i>teom</i>
and <i>beom</i> or <i>tama</i> and <i>vyoma</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>9. Being then determined to bring forth the creation, I
began to discern the world in its simple (ideal) form within
me, with the acuteness of my understanding. (<i>i.e.</i> I looked
into the prototypes or models of things contained in the
Mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>10. I then beheld in my mind the great cosmos of creation,
set unobstructed and apart from me in the wide extended
field of vacuity. (The archetypes of our ideas, are the
things existing out of us. Locke. Our ideas though seen
within us, form no part of ourselves or our being).</p>

<p class='c009'>11. Then the rays of my reflexion stretched out over them,
from amidst the lotus-cell of my abode, and sat in the form
of ten lotus-born Brahmás over the ten orbs (planets) of this
world; like so many swans brooding upon their eggs. (The
spirit of God that dove-like sat, brooding over the deep.
Milton).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. Then these separate orbs (mundane eggs), brought forth,
to light multitudes of beings, amidst their transparent aqueous
atmospheres. (All worlds girt by their covereles of watery
ether or nebulous clouds, teemed with productions of every kind).</p>

<p class='c009'>13. Thence sprang the great rivers and the roaring seas and
oceans; and thence again rose the burning lights and blowing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>winds of the firmament. (The atmospheric water is the source
of all things).</p>

<p class='c009'>14. The gods began to sport in the etherial air, and men moved
about on the earth, and demons and serpents were confined
in their abodes underneath the ground. (The gods are called
<i>devas</i> from their sporting in the regions of light—<i>divideváh
divyanti</i>. Men are <i>párthivas</i> from <i>prithví</i> the earth, and
demons are called infernal from their abode in the <i>infrapátála</i>
or antipodes).</p>

<p class='c009'>15. The wheel of time turns with the revolution of seasons
and their produce, and it adorns the earth with her various
productions by change of the seasons.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. Laws were fixed for all things on all sides, and human
actions were regulated in the <i>smritis</i> as right or wrong, and
producing as their fruits, the reward of heaven or the torments
of hell. (And Brahmá appointed to all beings their several laws.
Manu. And there is no single atom that goes beyond its appointed
law—nature or <i>dharma</i>, which is an attribute of the Great God).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. All beings are in pursuit of their enjoyments and liberty,
and the more they strive for their desired objects, the better they
thrive in them. (The gloss makes the pursuit of earthly enjoyments
to be the cause of pain and hell, and that of liberation
from them to be productive of heavenly bliss).</p>

<p class='c009'>18. In this way were the sevenfold worlds and continents, the
septuple oceans and the seven boundary mountains, brought to
existence, and they continue to exist until their final dissolution
at the end of a <i>Kalpa</i> period (which is determined by the
<i>Kalpa</i> or will of God).</p>

<p class='c009'>19. The primeval darkness fled before light from the face
of open lands, and took its refuge in mountain caverns and
hollow caves; it abides in some places allied with light,
as in the shady and sunny forest lands and lawns.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. The azure sky like a lake of blue lotuses, is haunted by
fragments of dark clouds, resembling swarms of black-bees on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>high; and the stars twinkling in it, liken the yellow filaments
of flowers shaken by the winds.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. The huge heaps of snow setting in the valleys of high hills,
resemble the lofty <i>simula</i> trees beset by their pods of cotton.</p>

<p class='c009'>22. The earth is encircled by the polar mountains serving as
her girdles, and the circles of the polar seas serving as her
sounding anklets and trinkets. She is girt by the polar darkness
as by a blue garment, and studded all about with gems, growing
and glowing in the bosoms of her rich and ample mines and
seas.</p>

<p class='c009'>(The lokáloka or polar mountain, is so called from its having
eternal light and night on either side, turned towards or beyond
the solar light).</p>

<p class='c009'>23. The earth covered over by the garniture of her verdure,
resembles a lady sitting begirt by her robes; and having the
produce of paddy for her victuals; and the busy buzz of the
world for her music.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. The sky appears as a bride veiled under the sable mantle of
night, with the glittering chains of stars for her jewels. The
season fruits and flowers hanging in the air, resemble wreaths
of lotuses about her person.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. The orbs of worlds appear as the beautiful fruits of
pomegranates, containing all their peoples in them, like the
shining grains of granites in the cells of those fruits.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. The bright moon-beams stretching both above and below and
all around the three sides, appear as the white sacred thread,
girding the world above and below and all about; or as the
stream of Gangá running in three directions in the upper,
lower and nether worlds.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. The clouds dispersing on all sides with their glittering
lightnings, appear as the leaves and flowers of aerial forests,
blown away by the breezes on all sides.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. But all these worlds with their lands and seas, their skies
and all their contents, are in reality as unreal as the visionary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>dreams; and as delusive as the enchanted city of the Fairy land.</p>

<p class='c009'>29. The gods and demons, men and serpents, that are seen in
multitudes in all worlds, are as bodies of buzzing gnats,
fluttering about the <i>dumbura</i>—fig trees. (Udumbara is the
ficus religiosus—yajnadumbura or sacred fig tree. It is by the
orthographical figure aphaeresis or elision of the initial, that
<i>udumbara</i> is made <i>dumbura, vulgo</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>30. Here time is moving on with his train of moments and minutes,
his ages, <i>yugas</i> and <i>kalpas</i>, in expectation of the unforeseen
destruction of all things. (Time devours and destroys all things).</p>

<p class='c009'>31. Having seen all these things in my pure and enlightened
understanding, I was quite confounded to think, whence could
all these have come into being. (The first inquiry into the
cause and origin of beings).</p>

<p class='c009'>32. Why is it that I do not see with my visual organs, all that
I perceive, as a magic scene spread out in the sphere of my Mind?</p>

<p class='c009'>33. Having looked into these for a long time with my steadfast
attention, I called to me the brightest sun of these luminous
spheres and addressed him saying:—(The first address of
Brahmá to the sun, corresponds with Adam’s address to that
luminary. “Thou glorious sun nature’s first born and the light
and life &amp;c.” Milton).</p>

<p class='c009'>34. Approach to me, O god of gods, luminous sun! I
welcome thee to me! Having accosted him thus, I said:—</p>

<p class='c009'>35. Tell me what thou art and how this world with all its
bright orbs came to being; if thou knowest aught of these,
then please reveal it to me.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. Being thus addressed, he looked upon me, and then
having recognized me, he made his salutation, and uttered in
graceful words and speech.</p>

<p class='c009'>37. The sun replied:—Thou lord! art the eternal cause of
these false phenomena, how is it then that thou knowest
it not, but askest me about the cause thereof?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>38. But shouldst thou, all knowing as thou art, take a
delight in hearing my speech, I will tell thee of my unasked
and unthought of production, which I beg thee to attend to.</p>

<p class='c009'>39. O great Spirit! this world being composed of reality
and unreality in its twofold view, beguiles the understanding
to take it sometimes for a real and at others for an unreal thing.
It is the great mind of the Divine Soul, that is thus employed
in these incessant and unceasingly endless creations for its
diversion. (The soul is the animating power, and the mind is the
principle of action. Metaphysically, the soul is an individual
name; the mind is a generic term or genus. The soul is opposed
to body, the mind to matter. The soul is the principle of
animation, the mind of volition. The soul is the mind of a
certain being, the mind is the soul without its personality).</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. The Sun’s Narrative of Indu and his Devotion.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> Sun continued:—It was, my lord! only the other day
of one of thy by gone kalpas, and at the foot of a mount,
beside the table-land of mount Kailasa standing in a corner of
the continent of Jambudvípa:—(A kalpa is one day of Brahmá,
and occupies the whole duration of a creation from its beginning
to the end, which is called the Kalpánta or night of the god.
This agrees with the seven days of creation in the book of
Genesis, which are supposed to embrace so many long ages of
creation).
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. That there lived a man by name of Suvarnajatá together
with all his sons and their progeny, who had rendered that spot
a beautiful and pleasant habitation. (The gloss says they were
the patriarchs of mankind, settled first on the table-land and
at the foot of the Himalayas).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. There lived among them a Bráhman by name of Indu, a
descendant of the patriarch Kasyapa, who was of a saintly
soul, virtuous and acquainted with divine knowledge.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. He resided in his residence with all his relatives, and passed
his time agreeably in company with his wife, who was dear to
his heart as his second self. (That, woman is <i>ardhánga</i> or half
of the body of man, is established in Hindu law; and represented
in mythology in the androgyne figures of Hara-Gaurí and Umá-Maheswara).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. But there was no issue born of this virtuous pair, as there grows
no grass in a sterile soil; and the wife remained discontented
at the unfruitfulness of her efflorescence or seed.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. With all the purity and simplicity of their hearts, and the
beauty and gracefulness of their persons and manners; they were
as useless to the earth, as the fair and straight stem of the pure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>paddy plant, without its stalk of corn. The discontented pair
then repaired to the mountain, in order to make their devotion
for the blessing of progeny.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. They ascended the Kailása mountain, which was unshaded by
shady trees, and unpeopled by living beings; and there they stood
fixed on one side, like a couple of trees in the barren desert.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. They remained in their austere devotion, subsisting upon
liquid food which supported the trees also. They drank but a
draught of water, which they held in the hollow of their palms,
from a neighbouring cascade at the close of the day. (There
is no single word for a <i>gandusha</i> or <i>chuluka</i> of water in English;
the word handful being equivalent to <i>mushthi</i> and <i>prastha</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>9. They remained standing and unmoved as immovable trees, and
continued long in that posture, in the manner of an erect wood
in heat and cold. (<i>Várkshivritti</i> means intense meditation
conducted by forgetting one’s self to wood or stone).</p>

<p class='c009'>10. They passed in this manner the period of two ages,
before their devotion met with the approbation of the god,
who bears the crescent of the moon on his forehead. (This
crescent was no doubt the missile disk, which the war-like
god Siva held on his head in the manner of the Seiks).</p>

<p class='c009'>11. The god advanced towards the parching pair, with the
cooling moon-beams on his forehead; as when that luminary
casts her dewy light on the dried trees and scorched
lotuses, under the burning sun beams of a summer day.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. The god, mounted on his milk-white bull, and clasping
the fair Umá on his left, and holding the beaming moon on his
head, appeared to them, as the vernal season was approaching
to a green wood (or furze), with strewing flowers upon them.
(There is an alliteration of <i>soma</i> and <i>soma</i> in the double sense
of Uma and the moon. This kind of play upon words is very
characteristic of metaphysical writers in all ages, as <i>Alethes
melethon</i>. Lewis Hist. Phil. I. 69).</p>

<p class='c009'>13. They with brightening eyes and faces beheld the god,
as the lotuses hail the appearance of the comely moon; and
then bowed down to the god of the silvery bow and snow white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>countenance. (Kálidása in his Mahápadya, has heaped all these
and many more ensigns of whiteness on the hoary Hara of
Himálaya).</p>

<p class='c009'>14. Then the god rising to their view like the full moon,
and appearing in the midst of the heaven and earth, spoke
smilingly unto them in a gentle and audible voice; the breath
of which refreshed them, like the breath of spring reviving
the faded plants of the forest.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. The god said:—I am pleased with thy devotion,
O Bráhman! prefer thy prayer to me, and have thy
desired boon granted to thee immediately.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. The Bráhman replied:—O Lord of gods, deign to favour
me with ten intelligent male children. Let these be born of
me to dispel all my sorrows (for want of a male issue).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. The sun rejoined:—The god said, be it so, and then
disappeared in the air; and his great body passed through the
etherial path, like the surge of the sea with the tremendous
roar of thunders.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. The Bráhmanic couple then returned to their home with
gladness of their hearts, and appeared as the reflexions of
the two divinities Siva and Umá in their persons. (The god
Siva otherwise called Hara, bears every resemblance to Hercules
(Harakula) the son of Jove (Siva); and his consort Umá to
Omphale the wife of Hercules. Todd’s Rajasthan).</p>

<p class='c009'>19. Returning there, the Bráhmani became big with
child, by the blessing she had got of her god Siva.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. She appeared as a thick cloud heavy with rain water, in
the state of her full pregnancy; and brought forth in proper
time (of child-birth), a boy as beautiful as the digit of the
new moon.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. Thus there were born of her ten sons in succession, all
as handsome as the tender sprouts of plants; and these grew
up in strength and stature, after they had received their
sacramental investitures.</p>

<p class='c009'>22. In course of a short time, they attained their boyhood,
and became conversant in the language of the gods (Sanskrit);
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>as the mute clouds become sonorous in the rainy season. (The
Sanskrita, says Sir W. Jones, is more sonorous than Latin.
It is the voice of gods, which is as high sounding as the
roaring of clouds).</p>

<p class='c009'>23. They shone in their circle with the lustre of their
persons, as the resplendent orbs of the sky burn and turn
about in their spheres.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. In process of time these youths lost both their parents,
who shuffled off their mortal coil to go to their last abode.
(<i>i.e.</i> To be amalgamated with the person of Brahmá, with which
they were acquainted by their proficiency in yoga divinity).</p>

<p class='c009'>25. Being thus bereft of both their parents, the ten Bráhman lads
left their home in grief, and repaired to the top of the Kailása
mountain, to pass there their helpless lives in mourning.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. Here they conversed together about their best welfare, and
the right course that they should take to avoid the troubles
and miseries of life.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. They parleyed with one another on the topics, of what
was the best good (<i>Summum bonum</i>) of humanity in this world
of mortality, and many other subjects (which form the common
places in ethics), such as:—</p>

<p class='c009'>28. What is true greatness, best riches and affluence, and
the highest good of humankind? What is the good of great
power, possessions, chiefship and even the gain of a kingdom?
What forms the true dignity of kings, and the high majesty
of emperors?</p>

<p class='c009'>29. What avails the autocracy of the great Indra, which is
lost in one moment (a moment’s time of Brahmá). What is
that thing which endures a whole kalpa, and must be the
best good as the most lasting?</p>

<p class='c009'>30. As they were talking in this manner, they were interrupted
by the eldest brother, with a voice as grave, as that of the
leader of a herd of deer to the attentive flock.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. Of all kinds of riches and dignities, there is one thing
that endureth for a whole kalpa, and is never destroyed; and
this is the state of Brahmá, which I prize above all others.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>32. Hearing this, the good sons of Indu exclaimed all in
one voice saying:—Ah! well said; and then they honoured
him with their mild speeches.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. They said: How—O brother, can it be possible for us to
attain to the state of Brahmá, who is seated on his seat of
lotuses, and is adored by all in this world?</p>

<p class='c009'>34. The eldest brother then replied to his younger brothers
saying:—O you my worthy brothers, do you do as I tell you,
and you will be successful in that.</p>

<p class='c009'>35. Do you but sit in your posture of <i>padmásana</i>, and think
yourselves as the bright Brahmá and full of his effulgence; and
possessing the powers of creation and annihilation in yourselves.
(Padmásana is a certain posture with crossed legs for conducting
the yoga).</p>

<p class='c009'>36. Being thus bid by the eldest brother, the younger brothers
responded to him by saying “<i>Amen</i>”; and sat in their meditation
together with the eldest brother, with gladness of their
hearts.</p>

<p class='c009'>37. They remained in their meditative mood, like the still
pictures in a painting; and their minds were concentrated in
the inmost Brahmá, whom they adored and thought upon,
saying:—</p>

<p class='c009'>38. Here I sit on the pericarp of a full blown lotus, and find
myself as Brahmá—the great god, the creator and sustainer
of the universe.</p>

<p class='c009'>39. I find in me the whole ritual of sacrificial rites, the
Vedas with their branches and supplements and the Rishis;
I view in me the Sarasvatí and Gáyatrí mantras of the Veda,
and all the gods and men situated in me.</p>

<p class='c009'>40. I see in me the spheres of the regents, of the world, and
the circles of the Siddhas revolving about me; with the spacious
heaven bespangled with the stars.</p>

<p class='c009'>41. I see this terraqueous orb ornamented with all its oceans
and continents, its mountains and islands, hanging as an ear-ring
in the mundane system.</p>

<p class='c009'>42. I have the hollow of the infernal world, with its demons,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>and Titans, and serpents and dragons within myself; and I have
the cavity of the sky in myself, containing the habitations and
damsels of the immortals.</p>

<p class='c009'>43. There is the strong armed Indra, the tormentor of
the lords of peoples; the sole lord of the three worlds,
and the receiver of the sacrifices of men.</p>

<p class='c009'>44. I see all the sides of heaven spread over by the bright
net of the firmament; and the twelve suns of the twelve months
dispensing their ceaseless beams amidst it.</p>

<p class='c009'>45. I see the righteous regents of the sky and the rulers
of men, protecting their respective regions and peoples with the
same care, as the cowherds take for protection of their cattle.</p>

<p class='c009'>46. I find every day among all sorts of beings, some rising
and falling, and others diving and floating, like the incessant
waves of the sea. (Everything is changing in the changeful
world).</p>

<p class='c009'>47. It is I (the Ego) that create, preserve and destroy the
worlds, I remain in myself and pervade over all existence, as
the lord of all.</p>

<p class='c009'>48. I observe in myself the revolution of years and ages,
and of all seasons and times, and I find the very <i>time</i>, to be
both the creator and destroyer of things.</p>

<p class='c009'>49. I see a <i>Kalpa</i> passing away before me, and the night of
Brahmá (dissolution) stretched out in my presence; while I
reside for ever in the Supreme soul, and as full and perfect
as the Divine Spirit itself. (Immortality of the human soul
and its unity with the Divine).</p>

<p class='c009'>50. Thus these Bráhmans—the sons of Indu, remained in this
sort of meditation, in their motionless postures like fixed
rocks, and as images hewn out of stones in a hill.</p>

<p class='c009'>51. In this manner these Bráhmans continued for a long period
in their devotion, being fully acquainted with the nature of
Brahmá, and possest of the spirit of that deity in themselves.
They sat in their posture of the <i>padmásana</i> on seats of kusa
grass, being freed from the snare of the fickle and frivolous
desires of this false and frail world.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>It is evident from this instance of the Bráhmans’ devotion,
that it consisted of the contemplation of every thing in the
world in the mind of man; like that of the whole universe in
the mind of God. It is the subjective view of the objective
that forms what is truely meant by yoga meditation and nothing
beside.</p>

Argument:—The Spiritual body or soul, is not
destroyed by destruction of the material Body.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> Sol said:—O great father of creation! thus did these
venerable Bráhmans, remain at that spot, occupied with these
various thoughts (of existence) and their several actions
in their minds for a long time. (This sort of yoga meditation
is called Sárúpya, or approximation of one to the divine
attribute, of thinking on the States and functions of all
things in the world in one’s self).
 </p>

<p class='c009'>2. They remained in this state (of abstraction), until their
bodies were dried up by exposure to the sun and air, and dropped
down in time like the withered leaves of trees. (This is called
the Samádhi yoga or absorption in meditation, until one’s final
extinction or Euthanasia in the Spirit).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Their dead bodies were devoured by the voracious beasts
of the forest, or tossed about as some ripe fruits by the monkeys
on the hills (to be food for greedy vultures and hungry dogs).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. These Bráhmans, having their thoughts distracted from
outward objects, and concentrated in Brahmáhood, continued
in the enjoyment of divine felicity in their Spirits, until
the close of the kalpa age at the end of the four yugas.</p>

<p class='c009'>(The duration of a day of Brahmá extends over a kalpa age
composed of four yugas, followed by his night of <i>kalpánta</i>, when
he becomes extinct in his death-like sleep, the twin brother of
death. <i>Ho hupnos esti didumos adelphos thanatow</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. At the end of the kalpa, there is an utter extinction of the
solar light, by the incessant rains poured down by the heavy
Pushkara and Avartaka clouds at the great deluge (when the
doors of heaven were laid open to rain in floods on earth. Genesis).</p>

<p class='c009'>6. When the hurricane of desolation blew on all sides, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>buried all beings under the Universal ocean (which covered
the face of the earth).</p>

<p class='c009'>7. It was then thy dark night, and the previous creation slept
as in their yoga-<i>nidrá</i> or hypnotic trance in thy sleeping self.
Thus thou continuing in thy spirit, didst contain all things in
thee in their spiritual forms. (Darkness reigned on the deep, and
the spirit of God viewed everything in itself).</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Upon thy waking this day with thy desire of creation, all these
things are exhibited to thy view, as a copy of all that was in thy
inmost mind or Spirit already. (So it is upon our waking from sleep,
we come to see a <i>fac-simile</i> of all that lay dormant in the sleeping
mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>9. I have thus related to you O Brahmá! how these ten
Bráhmans were personified as so many Brahmás; these have
become the ten bright orbs situated in the vacuous sphere of
thy mind. (An English poet has expressed the holy soul to
appear as a luminary in heaven).</p>

<p class='c009'>10. I am the one eldest among them, consecrated in this
temple of the sky, and appointed by thee, O lord of all!
to regulate the portions of time on earthly beings.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. Now I have given you a full account of the ten orbs of
heaven, which are no other than the ten persons united in the
mind of Brahmá, and now appearing as detached from him.
(Mentally viewed, everything is found situated in the mind,
but when seen with open eyes, it seems to be set apart from us.
Have therefore your thoughts or your sights as you may choose).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. This beautiful world that you behold, appearing to your
view, with all its wonderful structures, spread out in the skies,
serves at best as a snare to entrap your senses, and delude your
understanding, by taking the unrealities as realities in your
mind. (Brahmá the Demiurgus, being but architect of the world,
and a person next to or an emanation of the mind of God, had
not the intelligence of the soul, to discern the innate ideas,
which represented themselves in the outer creation).</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument.—That God expects nothing from his creation.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">B</span>rahmá</span> said:—O Bráhman! that art the best of Bráhmists (Bráhmos),
the God Sol having thus spoken of the ten Bráhmanas to Bráhma (me),
held his silence. (Here is a tautology of the word Bráhman in the
fashion of metaphysicians in its several homonymous significations.
This is an address of Brahmá to Vasishtha—the Bráhman and Brahmist,
relating the Bráhmanas).
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. I then thought upon this for sometime in my mind, and
said afterwards, O Sol, Sol! do thou tell me at present what
I am next to create. (Brahmá’s asking the sun about what
he was next to create, bears allusion to his works of creation
during the six days of genesis, which was directed by the course
of the sun—his morning and evening),</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Tell me thou sun, what need is there of my making any
more worlds, after these ten orbs have come into existence.
(These ten orbs are the ten planetary bodies belonging to
the solar system).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Now O great sage! the sun having long considered in his
mind about what I wanted him to tell, replied to me in the
following manner in appropriate words.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. The sun said:—What need hast thou of the act of creating,
my lord! that art devoid of effort or desire? This work of
creation is only for thy pleasure (and not for any use to thee).</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Thou lord that art free from desires, givest rise to worlds,
as the sunbeams raise the waters, and the sunshine is accompanied
by the shadow (as its inseparable companion).</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Thou that art indifferent to the fostering or forsaking of thy
body (<i>i.e.</i> either to live or die), needst have nothing to desire
nor renounce for thy pleasure or pain. (No gain or loss can add
to the joy or grief of the apathetic philosophic mind).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>8. Thou, O Lord of creatures! dost create all these for the
sake of thy pleasure only, and so dost thou retract them all in
thyself, as the sun gives and withdraws his light by turns.
(Creation and annihilation are the acts of expansion and
subtraction of all things, from and in the supreme spirit).</p>

<p class='c009'>9. Thou that art unattached to the world, makest thy creation
out of the work of love to thee, and not of any effort or
endeavour on thy part.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. If thou desist from stretching the creation out of the
Supreme Spirit, what good canst thou derive from thy inactivity?
(Wherefore it is better to do and produce something than
nothing).</p>

<p class='c009'>11. Do thy duty as it may present itself to thee, rather than
remain inactive with doing nothing. The dull person who like
the dirty mirror, does not reflect the image, comes to no use at
all.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. As the wise have no desire of doing anything which is
beyond their reach, so they never like to leave out anything
which is useful, and presents itself before them. (Nor long for
more, nor leave out your own. Or, Act well thy part &amp;c.).</p>

<p class='c009'>13. Therefore do thy work as it comes to thee, with a cheerful
heart, and calmness of mind; with a tranquil soul, as if it
were in thy sleep, and devoid of desires which thou canst
never reap.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. As thou dost derive pleasure, O Lord of worlds! in forming
the orbs of the sons of Indu, so the lord of gods will give
thee thy reward for thy works of creation.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. The manner in which, O lord, thou seest the worlds with
the eyes of thy mind, nobody can see them so conspicuously
with their external organs of vision; for who can say by seeing
them with his eyes, whether thy are created or increate.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. He who has created these worlds from his mind, it is he
alone that can behold me face to face, and no other person
with his open eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. The ten worlds are not the work of so many Brahmás as it
appeared to thee before; and no body has the power to destroy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>them, when they are seated so firmly in the mind. (It may be
easy to destroy all visible objects, but not to efface the
impressions of the mind (memory)).</p>

<p class='c009'>18. It is easy to destroy what is made by the hand, and to
shut out the sensible objects from our perception; but who
can annul or disregard what is ascertained by the mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. Whatever belief is deep-rooted in the minds of living
beings, it is impossible to remove it by any body, except
by its owner (by change of his mind or its forgetfulness).</p>

<p class='c009'>20. Whatever is habituated to confirmed belief in the mind,
no curse can remove it from the mind, though it can kill the
body.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. The principle that is deeply rooted in the mind, the same
forms the man according to its stamp; it is impossible to
make him otherwise by any means, as it is no way possible
to fructify a rock by watering at its root like a tree.</p>

Argument. A Rooted Belief is not to be
shaken by others as in the case of Lovers.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> Sol said:—The mind is the maker and master of the
world; the mind is the first supreme Male: Whatever
is done by the Mind (intentionally), is said to be
done; the actions of the body are held as no acts.
 </p>

<p class='c009'>2. Look at the capacity of the mind in the instance of the
sons of Indu; who being but ordinary Bráhmans, became assimilated
to Brahmá, by their meditation of him in their minds.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. One thinking himself as composed of the body (<i>i.e.</i> a
corporeal being), becomes subject to all the accidents of
corporeality: But he who knows himself as bodiless (an
incorporeal being), is freed from all evils which are
accidental to the body.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. By looking on the outside, we are subjected to the feelings
of pain and pleasure; but the inward-sighted yogi, is unconscious
of the pain or pleasure of his body. (Lit. of what is pleasant or
unpleasant to the body).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. It is thus the mind that causes all our errors in this world,
as it is evidenced in the instance of Indra and his consort Ahalyá
(related in the ancient legends).</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Brahmá said:—Tell me, my Lord Sol, who was this Indra,
and who that Ahalyá, by the hearing of which my understanding
may have its clear-sightedness.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. The sun said:—It is related my lord! that there reigned
in former times a king at Magadha (Behar), Indra-dyumna
by name, and alike his namesake (in prowess and fame).</p>

<p class='c009'>8. He had a wife fair as the orb of moon, with her eyes as
beautiful as lotuses. Her name was Ahalyá and she resembled
Rohiní—the favourite of moon.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>9. In that city there lived a palliard at the head of all the
rakes; he was the intriguant son of a Bráhman, and was known
by the same name of Indra.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. Now this queen Ahalyá came to hear the tale of the
former Ahalyá wife of Gotama, and her concupiscence related
to her at a certain time.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. Hearing of that, this Ahalyá felt a passion for the other
Indra, and became impatient in the absence of his company;
thinking only how he should come to her.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. She was fading as a tender creeper thrown adrift in the
burning desert, and was burning with her inward flame, on beds
of cooling leaves of the watery lotus and plantain trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. She was pining amidst all the enjoyments of her royal
state, as the poor fish lying exposed on the dry bed of a
pool in summer heat.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. She lost her modesty with her self possession, and
repeated in her phrensy, “here is Indra, and there he
comes to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>15. Finding her in this pitiable plight, a lady of her palace
took compassion on her, and said, I will safely conduct Indra
before your ladyship in a short time.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. No sooner she heard her companion say “I will bring your
desired object to you,” than she oped her eyes with joy, and
fell prostrate at her feet, as one lotus flower falls before another.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. Then as the day passed on, and the shade of night covered
the face of nature, the lady made her haste to the house of
Indra—the Bráhman’s boy.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. The clever lady used her persuasions as far as she could,
and then succeeded to bring with her this Indra, and present
him before her royal mistress forthwith.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. She then adorned herself with pastes and paints, and
wreaths of fragrant flowers, and conducted her lover to a
private apartment, where they enjoyed their fill.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. The youth decorated also in his jewels and necklaces
delighted her with his dulcet caresses, as the vernal season
renovates the arbour with his luscious juice.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>21. Henceforward this ravished queen, saw the world full
with the figure of her beloved Indra, and did not think much of
all the excellences of her royal lord—her husband.</p>

<p class='c009'>22. It was after sometime, that the great king came to be
acquainted of the queen’s amour for the Bráhman Indra, by
certain indications of her countenance.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. For as long as she thought of her lover Indra, her face
glowed as the full blown lotus, blooming with the beams of
her moon like lover.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. Indra also was enamoured of her with all his enraptured
senses, and could not remain for a moment in any place without
her company.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. The king heard the painful tiding of their mutual affection,
and of their unconcealed meetings and conferences with
each other at all times.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. He observed also many instances of their mutual attachment,
and gave them his reprimands and punishments, as they
deserved at different times.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. They were both cast in the cold water of a tank in the cold
weather, where instead of betraying any sign of pain, they kept
smiling together as in their merriment.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. The king then ordered them to be taken out of the tank,
and told them to repent for their crimes; but the infatuated
pair, was far from doing so, and replied to the king in the
following manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>29. Great King! As long we continue to reflect on the
unblemished beauty of each other’s face, so long are we
lost in the meditation of one another, and forget our
own persons.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. We are delighted in our persecutions, as no torment can
separate us from each other, nor are we afraid of separation,
though O King, you can separate our souls from our bodies.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. Then they were thrown in a frying pan upon fire, where
they remained unhurt and exclaimed, we rejoice, O King! at
the delight of our souls in thinking of one another.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. They were tied to the feet of elephants, to be trampled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>down by them; but they remained uninjured and said, King
we feel our hearty joy at the remembrance of each other.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. They were lashed with rods and straps, and many other
sorts of scourges, which the king devised from time to time.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. But being brought back from the scourging ground, and
asked about their suffering, they returned the same answer
as before; and moreover, said Indra to the King, this world
is full with the form of my beloved one.</p>

<p class='c009'>35. All your punishments inflict no pain on her also, who
views the whole world as full of myself. (We see our beloved
in every shape. Hafiz. A thousands forms of my love, I see
around me. Urfi. “<i>berundaruna man sad surate O paidast</i>” <i>id</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>36. Therefore all your punishments to torment the body, can
give no pain to the mind (soul); which is my true self, and
constitutes my personality (<i>purusha</i>), which resides in my
person (purau sete).</p>

<p class='c009'>37. This body is but an ideal form, and presents a shadowy
appearance to view; you can pour out your punishments upon it
for a while; but it amounts to no more than striking a shadow
with a stick. (The body is a thing that my senses inform me,
and not an occult something beyond the senses. Berkeley.
Man can inflict the (unsubstantial) body, and not the
(substantial) spirit within. Gospel).</p>

<p class='c009'>38. No body can break down the brave (firm) mind; then
tell me great king! what the powers of the mighty amount to?
(The mind is invulnerable, and no human power can break its
tenor).</p>

<p class='c009'>39. The causes that conspire to ruffle the tenor of the resolute
mind, are the erroneous conceptions of external appearances.
It is better therefore to chastise such bodies which mislead the
mind to error. (The certainty of the uncertainty of our bodies,
is the only certain means for the certitude of our minds and
safety of our souls; and better is it for us that our bodies be
destroyed, in order to preserve our minds and souls intact).</p>

<p class='c009'>40. The mind is firm for ever that is steadfast to its fixed purpose.
Nay it is identified with the object which it has constantly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>in its thoughts. (This is called mental metamorphosis
or assimilation to the object of thought, as there is a physical
transformation of one thing to another form by its constant
contact with the same; such as by the law of chemical affinities,
which is termed yoga also in Indian medical works).</p>

<p class='c009'>41. Being and not being are words applicable to bodies
(and are convertible to one another); but they do not apply
to the mind; since what is positive in thought, cannot be
negatived of it in any wise.</p>

<p class='c009'>42. The mind is immovable and cannot be moved by any
effort like mobile bodies. It is impregnable to all external
actions, and neither your anger or favour (barasápa), can make
any effect on it.</p>

<p class='c009'>43. It is possible for men of strong resolutions to change
the coarse of their actions; but where is such a strong minded
man to be found, who is able to withstand or change the
current of his thought?</p>

<p class='c009'>44. It is impossible to move the mind from its fixed fulcrum,
as it is impracticable for tender stags to remove a mountain
from its base. This black-eyed beauty is the fixed prop of
my mind. (The black eyed beauty of India and Asia, is very
naturally opposed to the blue eyed maid of Homer and Europe).</p>

<p class='c009'>45. She is seated in the lofty temple of my mind, as the
goddess <i>bhavání</i> (Juno) on the mount Kailása (Olympus); and
I fear nothing as long I view this beloved preserver of my life
and soul before me. (The Persian poet Urfi uses the same simile
of the temple and mind in the hemistich or distich. “I see
her image in my inward shrine, as an idol in the temple of an
idolatrous land).”</p>

<p class='c009'>46. I sit amidst the conflagration of a burning mountain in
summer’s heat, but am cooled under the umbrage of her showering
cloud, wherever I stand or fall.</p>

<p class='c009'>47. I think of nothing except of that sole object of my
thought and wish, and I cannot persuade myself, to believe me
as any other than Indra the lover of Ahalyá.</p>

<p class='c009'>48. It is by constant association, that I have come to this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>belief of myself; nor can I think of me otherwise than what is
in my nature; for know, O King! The wise have but one and
the same object in their thought and view. (So says Hafiz:—If
thou wilt have her, think not of another).</p>

<p class='c009'>49. The mind like the Meru, is not moved by threat or
pity; it is the body that you can tame by the one or other
expedient. The wise, O King! are masters of their minds, and
there is none and nothing to deter them from their purpose.</p>

<p class='c009'>50. Know it for certain, O King, that neither these bodies
about us, nor these bodies and sensations of ours are realities.
They are but shows of truth, and not the movers of the mind:
but on the contrary, it is the mind which supplies the bodies,
and senses with their powers of action; as the water supplies
the trees and branches with their vegetative juice.</p>

<p class='c009'>51. The mind is generally believed as a sensuous and passive
principle, wholly actuated by the outward impressions of senses;
but in truth it is the mind, which is the active and moving
principle of the organs of action. Because all the senses become
dormant in absence of the action of the mind; and so the functions
of the whole creation are at a stop, without the activity
of the Universal Mind—<i>anima mundi</i>. (See Psychology and
Mental Philosophy).</p>

Argument. Curses have power on the body, and not upon the mind.

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> Sol said:—The lotus-eyed king thus defied by this
perverse Indra, addressed the sage Bharata, who was
sitting by him (in the court-hall).
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. The king spoke:—Lord, you are acquainted with all
morality, and seest this ravisher of my wife, and hearest
the arrogant speech, that he utters before our face.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Deign, O great sage! pronounce thy fulmination upon
him without delay; because it is a breach of justice to
spare the wicked, as it is to hurt the innocent.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Being thus besought by the great king, Bharata the best
of the wise <i>munis</i>; considered well in his mind, the crime
of this wicked soul Indra.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. And then pronounced his imprecation by saying:—“Do you,
O reprobate sinner, soon meet with thy perdition, together
with this sinful woman, that is so faithless to her husband.”</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Then they both replied to the king and his venerable sage,
saying,—“what fools must ye be, to have thus wasted your
imprecation, the great gain of your devotion, on our devoted
heads” (knowing that our souls are invincible).</p>

<p class='c009'>7. The curse you have pronounced, can do us very little
harm; for though our bodies should fall, yet it cannot
affect our inward minds and spirits (which are unchangeable).</p>

<p class='c009'>8. The inner principle of the soul, can never be destroyed
by any body and anywhere; owing to its inscrutable, subtile
and intellectual nature.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. The Sol added:—This fascinated pair, that were over head
and ears in love, then fell down by effect of the denunciation,
as when the lopped branches fall upon the ground from the
parent tree.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>10. Being subjected to the torment of transmigration, they
were both born as a pair of deer in mutual attachment, and then
as a couple of turtle doves in their inseparable alliance.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. Afterwards, O lord of our creation, this loving pair came
to be born as man and woman, who by their practice of austerities,
came to be reborn as a Brahman and Brahmaní at last.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. Thus the curse of Bharata, was capable only of transforming
their bodies; and never to touch their minds or souls which
continued in their unshaken attachment in every state of
their transfiguration (or metamorphosis of the body only,
and no metempsychosis of the soul).</p>

<p class='c009'>13. Therefore wherever they come to be reborn in any shape they
always assume by virtue of their delusion and reminiscence,
the form of a male and female pair.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. Seeing the true love which subsisted between this loving
pair in the forest, the trees also become enamoured of the other
sex of their own kinds. (This refers to the attachment of the
male and female flowers, long before its discovery by Linnaeus).</p>

Argument. The Mind is the cause of all its creations.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> Sol continued:—Therefore I say, my lord! that the mind like
time, is indestructible of its nature, and the inavertible
imprecation of the sage, could not alter its tenor.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Therefore it is not right for thee, O great Brahmá! to
destroy the ideal fabric of the air-drawn world of the sons of
Indu, because it is improper for great souls, to put a check to
the fancies of others (but rather to let every one to delight
in his own hobby horse and romantic visions).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. What thing is there, O lord of lords! that is wanting
in thee in this universe of so many worlds, that should make
thy great soul, to pine for the air built worlds of Indu’s sons?
(It is not for noble minds to pine for the greatness of others,
nor repine at the loss which they may sustain).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. The mind is verily the maker of worlds, and is known as
the prime Male—Purusha (the Demiurgus or Protogonus). Hence
the mind that is fixed to its purpose, is not to be shaken
from it by the power of any imprecation or by virtue of any
drug or medicine, or even by any kind of chastisement.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. The mind which is the image of every body, is not destructible
as the body, but remains forever fixed to its purpose. Let
therefore the Aindavas continue in their ideal act of creation,
(as so many Brahmás themselves).</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Thou lord that hast made these creatures, remain firm in
thy place, and behold the infinite space which is spread out
before thee, and commensurate with the ample scope of thy
understanding, in the triple spheres of thy intellect and mind,
and the vast vacuity of the firmament. (<i>i.e.</i> The infinitude
of the etherial vacuum is co-extensive with the amplitude of
Brahmá’s mind, and the plenitude of creations).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>7. These three fold infinities of etherial, mental and intellectual
spaces, are but reflexions of the infinite vacuity of divine
intellect, and supply thee, O Brahmá, with ample space for thy
creation of as many worlds at thy will.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Therefore thou art at liberty to create <i>ad libitum</i>, whatever
thou likest and think not that the sons of Indu, have robbed thee
of anything; when thou hast the power to create everything.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. Brahmá said:—After the sun had spoken to me in this
manner, concerning the Aindava and other worlds, I reflected
awhile on what he said, and then answered him saying:—</p>

<p class='c009'>10. Well hast thou said, O sun, for I see the ample space of
air lying open before me; I see also my spacious mind and the
vast comprehension of my intellect, I will therefore go on with
my work of creation forever.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. I will immediately think about multitudes of material
productions, whereof O sun! I ordain thee as my first Manu or
progeny, to produce all these for me. (The sun light was the
first work of creation, and the measure of all created beings,
by his days and nights or mornings and evenings).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. Now produce all things as thou wilt, and according to my
behest, at which the refulgent sun readily complied to my request.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. Then this great luminary stood confest with his bipartite
body of light and heat; with the first of which he shone as the
sun in the midst of heaven.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. With the other property of the heat of his body, he became
my Manu or agent in the nether worlds. (The solar heat or calor,
is the cause of growth upon earth).</p>

<p class='c009'>15. And here he produced all things as I bade him do,
in the course of the revolutions of his seasons.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. Thus have I related to you, O sagely Vasishtha! all
about the nature and acts of the mind, and omnipotence of the
great soul; which infuses its might in the mind in its acts of
creation and production.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. Whatever reflexion is represented in the mind, the same
is manifested in a visible form, and becomes compact and stands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>confest before it. (The ideal becomes visible or the noumenal
is exprest in the phenomenal).</p>

<p class='c009'>18. Look at the extraordinary power of the mind, which
raised the ordinary Aindava Brahmans to the rank of Brahmá,
by means of their conception of the same in themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. As the living souls of the Aindavas, were incorporated
with Brahmá, by their intense thought of him in them (or by
their mental absorption of themselves in him); so also have
we attained to Brahmáhood, by means of our mental conception
of that spiritual light and supreme intellect in ourselves.
(So in our daily ritual,अहं ब्रह्म नचान्यस्मि, ब्रह्मैवास्मिन शौकभाक् । सच्चिदानन्दरूपोऽहं, नित्यमुक्त स्वभाववन् ॥
</p>

<p class='c009'>20. The mind is full of its innate ideas, and the figure that
lays a firm hold of it, the same appears exprest without it in
a visible shape; or else there is no material substance beside
one’s own mind. (This is the doctrine of conceptionalists,
that all outward objects are but representations of our inborn
ideas, in opposition to the belief of sensationalists, that the
internal notions are reflections of our external sensations).</p>

<p class='c009'>21. The mind is the wonderful attribute of the soul, and
bears in itself many other properties like the inborn pungency
of the pepper. (These inborn properties are the memory,
imagination and other faculties of the mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. These properties appear also as the mind, and are called
its hyperphysical or mental faculties; while it is downright
mistake on the part of some to understand them as belonging
to the body. (The sánkhya materialists understand the internal
faculties as products of the body and matter).</p>

<p class='c009'>23. The self same mind is termed also the living principle—Jíva
(Zoa), when it is combined with its purer desires; and is
to be known after all to be bodiless and unknown in its nature.
(The life being combined with gross desires, assumes the body
for its enjoyment of them, but loosened from its fetters, it
resumes its purer nature. Hence the future spiritual life, is
free from grosser wishes).</p>

<p class='c009'>24. There is no body as myself or any other person in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>world, except this wondrous and self-existent mind; which
like the sons of Indu, assumes the false conception of being
real Brahmás themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. As the Aindavas were Brahmás in their minds, so my
mind makes me a Brahmá also; it is the mind that makes one
such and such, according to the conception that he entertains
of himself. (We are in reality nothing, but what our minds
inform us to be).</p>

<p class='c009'>26. It is only by a conceit of my mind, that I think myself
situated as a Brahmá in this place; otherwise all these material
bodies, are known to be as unreal, as the vacuity of the soul
wherein they abide.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. The unsullied mind approximates the Divine, by its
constant meditation of the same; but being vitiated by the
variety of its desires, it becomes the living being, which at
last turns to animal life and the living body. (This is called
the incarnation of the living soul or the materialization of
the spirit).</p>

<p class='c009'>28. The intelligent body shines as any of the luminous
orbs in the world of the Aindavas, it is brilliant with the
intelligent soul, like the appearance of a visionary creation
of the mind. (The body is a creature of the mind like a figure
in its dream).</p>

<p class='c009'>29. All things are the productions of the mind and reflexions
of itself, like the two moons in the sky, the one being but a
reflexion of the other; and as the concepts of the Aindava
worlds.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. There is nothing as real or unreal, nor a personality
as I or thou or any other; the real and unreal are both alike,
unless it be the conception which makes something appear as a
reality which has otherwise no reality of itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. Know the mind to both active and inert (<i>i.e.</i> both as
spirit and matter). It is vast owing to the vastness of its
desires, and is lively on account of its spiritual nature of the
great God; but becomes inert by its incorporation with material
objects.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>32. The conception of phenomenals as real, cannot make
them real, any more than the appearance of a golden bracelet,
can make it gold, or the phenomenals appearing in Brahmá, can
identify themselves with Brahmá himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. Brahma being all in all, the inert also are said to be
intelligent, or else all beings from ourselves down to blocks,
are neither inert nor intelligent. (Because nothing exists
besides Brahma, wherefore what exists not, can be neither
one nor the other).</p>

<p class='c009'>34. It is said that the lifeless blocks, are without intelligence
and perception; but every thing that bears a like relation to
another, has its perception also like the other. (Hence all things
being equally related to Brahma, are equally sentient also in
their natures).<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c010'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>35. Know everything to be sentient that has its perception
or sensitivity; wherefore all things are possest of their
perceptivity, by the like relation (sádrisya-sambandha)
of themselves with the supreme soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. The terms inert and sensitive are therefore meaningless, in
their application to things subsisting in the same divine spirit;
and it is like attributing fruits and flowers to the arbors
of a barren land. The barren waste refers to the vacuum of the
divine mind, and its arbours to its unsubstantial ideas, which
are neither inert nor sentient like the fruits or flowers of
those trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>37. The notion or thought, which is formed by and is an act of
the intellect, is called the mind; of these the portion of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>intellect or intellectual part, is the active principle, but
the thought or mental part is quite inert.</p>

<p class='c009'>38. The intellectual part consists of the operation of intellection,
but the thoughts or thinkables (chetyas), which are the
acts of the chit or intellect are known to be inert; and these are
viewed by the living soul in the erroneous light of the world,
(rising and sitting before it like the sceneries of a phantasmagoria).</p>

<p class='c009'>39. The nature of the intellect—chit is a pure unity, but the
mind—<i>chitta</i> which is situated in the same, and thence called
<i>chit—stha</i> or posited in the intellect, is a <i>réchauffé</i> or dualism
of itself, and this appears in the form of a duality of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>40. Thus it is by intellection of itself as the other form, that
the noumenal assumes the shape of the phenomenal world; and
being indivisible in itself, it wanders through the labyrinth of
errors with its other part of the mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>41. There is no error in the unity of the intellect, nor is the soul
liable to error, unless it is deluded by its belief of pluralities.
The intellect is as full as the ocean, with all its thoughts rising
and sitting in it as its endless waves.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c010'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>42. That which you call the mental part of the intellect, is full
of error and ignorance; and it is the ignorance of the intellectual
part, that produces the errors of egoism and personality.</p>

<p class='c009'>43. There is no error of egoism or personality in the transcendental
category of the divine soul; because it is the integrity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>of all consciousness, as the sea is the aggregate of all
its waves and waters.</p>

<p class='c009'>44. The belief of egoism rises as any other thought of the
mind, and is as inborn in it as the water in the mirage,
which does not exist really in it.</p>

<p class='c009'>45. The term ego is inapplicable to the pure and simple internal
soul; which being vitiated by the gross idea of its concupiscence,
takes the name of ego, as the thickened coldness is called by
the name of frost.</p>

<p class='c009'>46. It is the pure substance of the intellect which forms the
ideas of gross bodies, as one dreams of his death in his sleep.
The all-pervading intelligence which is the all inherent and
omnipotent soul, produces all forms in itself, and of which
there is no end until they are reduced to unity.</p>

<p class='c009'>47. The mind manifests various appearances in the forms of
things, and being of a pure etherial form, it assumes various
shapes by its intellectual or spiritual body.</p>

<p class='c009'>48. Let the learned abstain from the thoughts of the threefold
forms of the pure intellectual, spiritual and corporeal bodies,
and reflect on them as the reflexions of the divine intellect
in his own mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>49. The mind being cleansed of its darkness like the mirror
of its dirt, shows the golden hue of spiritual light, which is
replete with real felicity, and by far more blissful than what
this earthly clod of body can ever yield.</p>

<p class='c009'>50. We should cleanse the mind which exists for ever, rather
than the body which is transient and non-existent; and as unreal
as the trees in the air, of which no one takes any notice.</p>

<p class='c009'>51. Those who are employed in the purification of their bodies,
under the impression that the body also is called the <i>átmá</i>
or soul (in some sástra); are the atheistic <i>chárvakas</i>, who are
as silly goats among men.</p>

<p class='c009'>52. Whatever one thinks inwardly in himself, he is verily
transformed to its likeness, as in the instance of the
Aindava Bráhmans, and of Indra and Ahalya cited before.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>53. Whatever is represented in the mirror of the mind, the same
appears in the figure of the body also. But as neither this
body nor the egoism of any one, is lasting for ever, it is
right to forsake our desires.</p>

<p class='c009'>54. It is natural for every body to think himself as an
embodied being, and to be subject to death (while in reality it
is the soul that makes the man, who is immortal owing to the
immortality of the soul). It is as a boy thinks himself to be
possessed of a demon of his own imagination, until he gets rid
of his false apprehension by the aid of reasoning.</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. Force of the Faculties of the Mind and Energy of Men.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> added:—Now hear, O support of Raghu’s race!
what I next proposed to the lotus-born lord Brahmá,
after we had finished the preceding conversation.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. I asked him saying:—Lord! you have spoken before of the
irrevocable power of curses and imprecations, how is it then
that their power is said to be frustrated again by men.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. We have witnessed the efficacy of imprecations, pronounced
with potent <i>Mantra</i>—anathemas, to overpower the understanding
and senses of living animals, and paralyze every member of
the body. (This speaks of the incantations and charms of the
Atharva Veda).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Hence we see the mind and body are as intimately connected
with each other, as motion with the air and fluidity with
the sesamum seed (because the derangement of the one is
attended by the disorganization of the other: <i>i.e.</i> of the
body and mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Or that there is no body except it but be a creation of
the mind, like the fancied chimeras of visions and dreams, and
as the false sight of water in the mirage, or the appearance of
two moons in the sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Or else why is it that the dissolution of the one, brings
on the extinction of the other, such as the quietus of the mind
is followed by the loss of bodily sensations?</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Tell me, my lord! how the mind is unaffected by the
power of imprecations and menace, which subdue the senses
and say whether they are both overpowered by these, being
the one and same thing.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Brahmá replied:—Know then, there is nothing in the
treasure-house of this world, which is unattainable by
man by means of his exertions in the right way.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>9. And that all species of animal being, from the state of the
highest Brahmá, down to minute insects, are <i>bicorpori</i> or
endowed with two bodies the mental and corporeal. (<i>i.e.</i> The
mind and the body).</p>

<p class='c009'>10. The one, that is the mental body, is ever active and
always fickle; and the other is the worthless body of flesh,
which is dull and inactive.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. Now the fleshy part of the body which accompanies all
animal beings, is overpowered by the influence of curses and
charms, practised by the art of incantation—<i>abhichára Vidyá</i>.
(Exorcism, the Mumbo Jumbo of the Tantras).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. The influence of certain supernatural powers stupifies a man,
 and makes him dull and dumb. Sometimes one is about to droop down
insensible, as spell bound persons are deprived of their external
senses, and fall down like a drop of water from a lotus-leaf.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. The mind which is the other part of the body of embodied
beings, is ever free and unsubdued; though it is always under
the subjection of all living beings in the three worlds.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. He who can control his mind by continued patience on
one hand, and by incessant vigilance on the other, is the man
of an unimpeachable character, and unapproachable by calamity.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. The more a man employs the mental part of his body to its
proper employment, the more successful he is in obtaining the
object he has in view. (Omnium vincit vigilentia <i>vel</i>
diligentia).</p>

<p class='c009'>16. Mere bodily energy is never successful in any undertaking
(any more than brute force); it is intellectual activity only,
that is sure of success in all attempts. (The head must guide
the body).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. The attention of the mind being directed to objects
unconnected with matter, it is as vain an effort to hurt
it (an immaterial object); as it is to pierce a stone with
an arrow (or to beat the air).</p>

<p class='c009'>18. Drown the body under the water or dip it in the mud, burn
it in the fire or fling it aloft in air, yet the mind turneth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>not from its pole; and he who is true to his purpose, is sure
of success. (The word <i>tatkshanát phalitah</i> or gaining immediate
success, is an incredible expression in the text).</p>

<p class='c009'>19. Intensity of bodily efforts overcomes all impediments,
but it is mental exertion alone which leads to ultimate success
in every undertaking (for without the right application of bodily
efforts under guidance of reason, there can be no expectation
of prospering in any attempt).</p>

<p class='c009'>20. Mark here in the instance of the fictitious Indra, who
employed all his thoughts to the assimilation of himself into
the very image of his beloved, by drowning all his bodily pains
in the pleasure of her remembrance.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. Think of the manly fortitude of Mándavya, who made his
mind as callous as marble, when he was put to the punishment
of the guillotine, and was insensible of his suffering. (So
it is recorded of the Sophist Mansur, who was guillotined for
his faith in the <i>anal Haq</i> “I am the True One,” and of the
martyrs who fell victims to their faith in truth).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. Think of the sage who fell in the dark pit, while his
mind was employed in some sacrificial rite, and was taken
up to heaven in reward of the merit of his mental sacrifice.
(Redemption is to be had by sacrifice of the soul, and not
of the body).</p>

<p class='c009'>23. Remember also how the sons of Indu obtained their
Brahmáhood, by virtue of their persevering devotion, and which
even I have not the power to withhold. (<i>i.e.</i> Even Brahmá is
unable to prevent one’s rising by his inflexible devotedness).</p>

<p class='c009'>24. There have been also many such sages and master-minds
among men and gods, who never laid aside their mental energies,
whereby they were crowned with success in their proper
pursuits.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. No pain or sickness, no fulmination nor threat, no
malicious beast or evil spirit, can break down the resolute
mind, any more than the striking of a lean lotus-leaf, can
split the breast of a hard stone.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. Those that you say to have been discomfited by tribulations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>and persecutions, I understand them as too infirm in their
faiths, and very weak both in their minds and manliness.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. Men with heedful minds, have never been entrapped in the
snare of errors in this perilous world; and they have never been
visited by the demon of despair, in their sleeping or waking states.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. Therefore let a man employ himself to the exercise of
his own manly powers, and engage his mind and his mental
energy to noble pursuits, in the paths of truth and holiness.</p>

<p class='c009'>29. The enlightened mind forgets its former darkness, and sees
its objects in their true light; and the thought that grows
big in the mind, swallows it up at last, as the fancy of a
ghost lays hold of the mind of a child.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. The new reflexion effaces the prior impression from the
tablet of the mind, as an earthen pot turning on the potter’s
wheel, no more thinks of its nature of dirty clay.</p>

<p class='c009'>(One risen to a high rank or converted to a new creed, entirely
forsakes and forgets his former state).</p>

<p class='c009'>31. The mind, <i>O muni!</i> is transmuted in a moment to its
new model; as the inflated or aerated water rises high into
waves and ebullitions, glaring with reflexions of sun-light.
(Common minds are wholly occupied with thoughts of the
present, forgetful of the past and careless of the future).</p>

<p class='c009'>32. The mind that is averse to right investigation, sees like
the purblind, every thing in darkness even in broad day light;
and observes by deception two moons for one in the moonshine.
(The uninquisitive are blind to the light of truth).</p>

<p class='c009'>33. Whatever the mind has in view, it succeeds soon in the
accomplishment of the same. And as it does aught of good or
evil, it reaps the reward of the same, in the gladness or
bitterness of his soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. A wrong reflector reflects a thing in a wrong light, as a
distracted lover sees a flame in the moonbeams, which makes him
burn and consume in his state of distraction. (This is said of
distracted lovers, who imagine cooling moon-beams and sandal-paste
as hot as fire, and inflaming their flame of love).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>35. It is the conception of the mind, that makes the salt seem
sweet to taste, by its giving a flavour to the salted food for
our zest and delight.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. It is our conception, that makes us see a forest in the fog,
or a tower in the clouds; appearing to the sight of the observer
to be rising and falling by turns.</p>

<p class='c009'>37. In this manner whatever shape the imagination gives to a
thing, it appears in the same visionary form before the sight of
the mind; therefore knowing this world of your imagination, as
neither a reality nor unreality, forbear to view it and its various
shapes and colours, as they appear to view.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXXXXIII.<br> <br><span class="smcap">A View of the Genesis of the mind and Body.</span><br></h2>
</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. First Birth of the Mind,  and then that of Light.
Next grew the Ego, and thence came out the World.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> said:—I will now tell you Ráma! What I was
instructed of yore by lord Brahmá himself. (The prime
progenitor of mankind and propounder of the Vedas).
 </p>

<p class='c009'>2. From the unspeakable Brahmá, there sprang all things in
their undefinable ideal state, and then the Spirit of God
 being condensed by His Will, it came to be produced of
itself in the form of the Mind. (The volitive and creative
agency of God).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. The Mind formed the notions of the subtile elementary
principles in itself, and became a personal agent (with its
power of volition or creative will). The same became a
luminous body and was known as Brahmá the first Male.
(Purusha or Protogonus—Pratha-janya or Prathamajanita).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Therefore know Ráma, this same Brahmá to be the <i>Parameshthi</i>
or situated in the Supreme, and being a personification of the
Will of God, is called the Mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. The Mind therefore known as the Lord Brahmá, is a form
of the Divine essence, and being full of desires in itself,
sees all its wills (in their ideal forms), present before it.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. The mind then framed or fell of itself, into the delusion
(avidyá), of viewing its ideal images as substantial (as one
does in his delirium); and thence the phenomenal world (with
whatever it contains), is said to be the work of Brahmá.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Thus the world proceeding in this order from the Supreme
essence, is supposed by some to have come into being from
another source, of dull material particles. (Doctrine of
Hylotheism or the Materialistic system of Sánkhya Philosophy),</p>

<p class='c009'>8. It is from that Brahmá, O Ráma! that, all things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>situated in this concave world, have come to being, in
the manner of waves rising on the surface of the deep.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. The self-existent Brahmá that existed in the form of
intellect (chit) before creation, the same assumed the attribute
of egoism (ahankára) afterwards, and became manifest in the
person of Brahmá. (Thence called Swayambhu or self-born).</p>

<p class='c009'>10. All the other powers of the Intellect, which were concentrated
in the personality of the Ego, were tantamount to those
of Omnipotence. (The impersonal Intellect and the personal
Ego or Brahmá, are both of them equally powerful).<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c010'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>11. The world being evolved from the eternal ideas in the Divine
Intellect, manifested itself in the mind of the great father
of all—Brahmá. (<i>Intellectus noster nihil intelligit sine
phantasmata</i>); it is the mind which moves and modifies them,
and is the Intelligence (logos-Word) of the One, and the
manifestation of its power.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. The Mind thus moving and modeling all things is called
the <i>Jíva</i> living soul or Nous. (The Scholiast says:—The Mind
is the genus—<i>Samashti</i>, the soul is an individual name (Vyashti)
of every individual living being. The Mind is soul without
personality; the soul is the mind of a certain being. The Mind
is the principle of volition, and the soul is that of animation).</p>

<p class='c009'>13. These living souls rise and move about in the vacuous
sphere of the infinite Intellect (chidákása). These are unfolded
by the elementary particles of matter, and pass in the open
space surrounded by air. They then reside in the fourteen
kinds of animated nature, according to the merit and demerit
of their prior acts. They enter the bodies through the passage
of their vital breath, and become the seeds of moving and immoving
beings.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. They are then born of the generative organ (foetus), and
are met on a sudden by the desires of their previous births
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>(which lay waiting on them). Thus led on by the current of
their wishes, they live to reap the reward or retribution
of their good or bad acts in the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. Thus bound fast to action and fettered in the meshes of
desire, the living souls enchained in their bodies, continue
to rove about or rise and fall in this changeful world by turns.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. Their wish is the cause of their weal or woe, says the
Sruti; and which is inseparable from the soul as volition from
the mind. (The wish is the inactive desire of the soul, and
volition the active will of the mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. Thousands of living souls, are falling off as fast as the
leaves of forest trees; and being borne away by the force of their
pursuits, they are rolling about as the fallen leaves wafted by
the breeze in the valleys. (The aberration of living souls from
the Supreme).</p>

<p class='c009'>18. Many are brought down and bound to innumerable births in
this earth, by their ignorance of the Chit or Divine Intellect,
and are subjected to interminable transmigrations in
various births.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. There are some who having passed many mean births in
this earth, have now risen high in the scale of beings, by
their devotedness to better acts (and are likely to have their
liberation in the course of their progression to the best).</p>

<p class='c009'>20. Same persons acquainted with spirituality, have reached
their state of perfection; and have gone to heaven, like
particles of sea-water, carried into the air above by the
blowing winds.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. The production of all beings is from the Supreme Brahmá;
but their appearance and disappearance in this frail world,
are caused by their own actions. Hence the actionless yogi,
is free from both these states. (God made everything perfect;
Man’s sin brought his death and woe).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. Our desires are poisonous plants, bearing the fruits
of pain and disappointment; and lead us to actions which are
fraught with dangers and difficulties. (Cursed was the ground
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>for man’s unrestricted desires, which sowed it with thorns and
thistles).</p>

<p class='c009'>23. These desires drive us to different countries, to distant
hills and dales in search of gain. (Else man could live content
with little and on his native plain).</p>

<p class='c009'>24. This world O Ráma! is a jungle of withered trees and
brambles; and requires the axe of reason to clear away these
drugs and bushes. So are our minds and bodies but plants
and trees of our woe, which being rooted out by the axe of
reason, will no more come to grow by their transmigration in
this earth. (The mind and body are rooted out by Suppression
of their desires and passions).</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXXXXIV.<br> <br><span class="smcap">Brahma the Origin of All.</span><br></h2>
</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. Description of the twelve species of
Human beings and the ways of their liberation.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> said:—Hear me now relate to you, Ráma! the several
classes of higher, lower and middling species of beings, and
the various grades of their existence here and elsewhere in
the scale of creation. (<i>i.e.</i> The spontaneous production of
beings <i>suo motu</i>, when they were not bound by <i>karma-vipáka</i> or
acts of a prior life, to be born in any particular form or
state on earth).
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. They were the first in their production, and are known as the
<i>idam-prathama</i>—or the first class in their birth, whose long
practice in a course of virtuous actions in prior states, has
secured to them the property of goodness—<i>satva-guna</i> only.
(These are the holy saints and sages, who are entitled to their
liberation in life time, and upon separation from their bodies).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. The second grade is called the <i>guna pívari</i> or state of
sound qualities, which is attained by the prosperous, and leads
them to meritorious deeds, to the acquisition of their desired
objects, and their right dealing in the affairs of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>(This meritorious state becomes entitled to liberation after
some births in this earth).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. The third grade is termed the <i>sasatwá</i>, or the state of
substantiality of men of substance. It is attended with like
results, proportioned to the righteous and unrighteous acts of men,
who may obtain their liberation after a hundred transmigrations
of their souls on earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>5 &amp; 6. The fourth grade comprises infatuated people called
<i>atyanta támasi</i>, who are addicted to their varying desires
in this changeful world, and come to the knowledge of truth,
after passing a thousand lives in ignorance and sin, and
suffering the effects proportionate to their good or evil deeds.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>7. The fifth grade is composed of men of a baser nature,
called <i>adhama-satwá</i> by the wise, and who may possibly have
their liberation, after a course of numberless births in
different shapes and forms.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. The sixth grade is composed of those extremely benighted
men (atyanta támasi), who are doubtful of their liberation
(<i>Sandigdha-moksha</i>), and continue in the vicious course of
their past lives.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. Those who after passing two or three previous births in
other states, are born afterwards with the quality of gentleness,
these are reckoned as the seventh grade, and are denominated
the Rájashi—gentry or gentility.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. Those who remain mindful of their duties, and are employed
in discharge of them in this state of life; are said by the
wise to be entitled to their liberation, soon after their
demise.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. Those among the Rájashi—gentility, whose acts are
commensurate with those of gentlemen and the nobility, are
included in the eighth class, and are called <i>Rája Sátwiki</i>—or
noble gentlemen; and are entitled to their liberation after a
few births on earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. The ninth class comprises the <i>rája-rájashi</i> or right
gentlemen, whose actions conform with their title, and who
obtain their long longed-for liberation, after a course of
hundred births in the same state.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. The next or tenth class is composed of the <i>rájatámasí</i>
or blinded gentry, who act foolishly under their infatuation;
and who are uncertain of their liberation, even after a
thousand births.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. The most giddy of this class is called <i>atyanta-rája-tamashi</i>,
or the excessively infatuated gentry, whose conduct in
life correspond with their name, and whose transmigration does
not cease at any time.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. Then the lower classes comprise the children of darkness
or ignorance—<i>tamas</i>; of whom the <i>támasas</i> form the eleventh
grade, and are said to be deprived of their liberation forever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>more. (These are the Rákshasas and demons of various orders).</p>

<p class='c009'>16. There have been a few however among them, who have
obtained their salvation by means of their divine knowledge,
and their good acts during their life time (such as Prahláda,
the son of a demon, and Karkotaka—the son of a Nága).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. Next follows the twelfth order of <i>támasa-rájasa</i>, who
combine in them the qualities of darkness and enlightenment,
and who are liberated after a thousand births in their former
demoniac state, and one hundred births in their progressive
improvements.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. Then comes the thirteenth order of <i>támas-támasi</i>
or those in darkest darkness, who have to transmigrate for
millions of years both in their prior and later births, before
they can have their liberation from the bondage of body.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. Last comes the fourteenth order of beings, who continue
in their state of gross ignorance (<i>atyanta—támasí</i>) forever,
and it is doubted whether they can have their liberation at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>(All these classes of human beings have proceeded from Brahmá,
whose life and spirit circulate in all of them; else they could
neither live nor breathe).</p>

<p class='c009'>20. All other masses of living beings also, have proceeded
from the body of the great Brahmá, as the moving waves rise
from the great body of waters.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. And as the lamp flickering by its own heat, scatters its
light on all sides; so does Brahmá glowing in himself, irradiate
his beams in the shape of scintilla, to spread all over the
universe: (which is the vacuity of Brahmá’s mind, and comprises
the cosmos within it).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. And as the sparks of fire are flung about by force of
the burning flame; so do these multitudes of produced beings
rise from the substance of Brahmá himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. As the dust and filaments of mandara flowers, fly to and
fill the air on all sides; and as the beams of the moon shoot
out of its orb, to fill the four quarters of heaven and earth;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>so the minutiæ of Divine essence emanate from the Deity, and
spread throughout the universe.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. As the variegated arbor, produces its leaves and flowers
of various hues from itself; so the varieties of created beings,
spring from one Brahmá—the source of all.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. As the gold ornaments are in relation to the metal gold
of which they are made, and wherein they subsist, so Ráma!
are all things and persons in relation to Brahmá, out of whom
they have sprung and in whom they abide.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. As the drops of water, are related to the pure water of
the cascade, so Ráma, are all things related to the increate
Brahmá, whence they issue as drizzling drops.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. As the air in a pot and about a basin, is the same with
the surrounding air of heaven; so are all individual objects the
same, with the undivided spirit of the all-pervading Brahmá.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. As the drops of rain-water, and those of water spouts,
whirlpools and waves, are identic with their parent waters; so
are all these phenomenal sights, the same with the great Brahmá,
whence they spring, and wherein they exist and subside.</p>

<p class='c009'>29. As the mirage presents the appearance of a billowy sea,
by the fluctuation of sunbeams on sand; so do all visible
objects show themselves to the sight of the spectator,
beside which they have no figure or form of themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. Like the cooling beams of the moon, and the burning
light of the sun, do all things shine with their different
lustres derived from Brahmá.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. It is He, from whom all things have risen, unto him they
return in their time; some after their transmigrations in a
thousand births, and others after longer periods of their
revolutions in various bodies.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. All these various forms of beings in the multiform world
are moving in their respective spheres by the will of the Lord.
They come and go, rise and fall, and shine in their transitory
forms, like the sparks of fire, fluttering and sparkling for a
moment, and then falling and becoming extinct for ever.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXXXXV.<br> <br><span class="smcap">Identity of the Actor and his Action.</span><br></h2>
</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. It is for persuasion of men addicted to
Acts that the Actor is identified with his Acts.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> said:—There is no difference of acts, from the
agent, as they have sprung together from the same source
of their creator: they are the simultaneous growth of
nature like flowers and their odour. (The Gitá says:—The
actor, act and its effect, are naturally united together).
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. When human souls are freed from their desires, they are
united with the supreme soul of Brahma, as the blueness of the
sky which appears distinct to the eyes of the ignorant, is found
to be joined with the clear firmament. (The human soul is a
shadow of the supreme, as blueness is a shade of vacuity).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Know, O Ráma! that it is for the understanding of the
ignorant, that the living souls are said to have sprung from
Brahma: when they are in reality but shadows of the same.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Wherefore it is not right on the part of the enlightened
to say that such and such things are produced from Brahma,
when there is nothing that exists apart or separate from him:
(on account of the unity of all existences and identity of the
actor and the act).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. It is a mere fiction of speech to speak of the world as
creation or production, because it is difficult to explain
the subject and object of the lecture, without the use of
such fictitious language (as the actor and act, the creator
and the created &amp;c.).</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Hence the language of dualists and pluralists is adopted in
monotheistic doctrines, as the expressions, this one is Brahma,
or divine soul, and these others are the living souls, as they
are in use in the popular language.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. It has been seen (explained), that the concrete world has
sprung from the discrete Brahma; because the production of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>something is the same with its material cause, though it
seems different from it to common understandings.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Multitudes of living beings rising like the rocks of Meru
and Mandara mountains, are joined with the main range from
which they jut out. (All are but parts of one undivided whole.
Pope.)</p>

<p class='c009'>9. Thousands and thousands of living beings, are incessantly
produced from their common source, like the innumerable sprigs
of forest trees, filling the woodland sky with their variegated
foliage. (So are all creatures but off shoots of the parent tree
of the Supreme Soul).</p>

<p class='c009'>10. An infinity of living beings will continue to spring
from the same, like blades of grass sprouting from the earth
below; and they will likewise be reduced to the same, like the
season plants of spring, dying away in the hot weather of
Summer.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. There is no counting of the living creatures that exist at
any time, and what numbers of them, are being born and dying
away at any moment (and like waves of water are rising and
falling at each instant).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. Men with their duties proceed from the same divine source,
like flowers growing with their fragrance from the same stem;
and all these subside in the same receptacle whence they
had their rise.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. We see the different tribes of demons and brutes, and
of men and gods in this world, coming into existence from
non-existence, and this is repeated without end.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. We see no other cause of their continuous revolution in this
manner, except the forgetfulness of their reminiscence, which
makes them oblivious of their original state, and conform with
every mode of their metempsychosis into new forms. (Otherwise
the retention of the knowledge of its original state and
former impressions, would keep it alive in the same state of
primeval purity, and exempt it from all transmigrations).</p>

<p class='c009'>15. Ráma said:—For want of such reminiscence, I think that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>obedience to the dictates of the infallible Sástras, which
have been promulgated by the sages, and based on the authority
of the Vedas, is the surest way for the salvation of mankind.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. And I reckon those men as holy and perfect, who are
possest of the virtues of the great, and have magnanimity and
equanimity of their souls, and have received the light of the
unknowable Brahma in them. (Such men are exempt from the
pain of transmigration).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. I reckon two things as the two eyes of the ignorant, for
their discernment of the path of salvation. The one is their
good conduct, and the other their knowledge of the Sástras,
which follows the former.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. Because one who is righteous in his conduct only, without
joining his righteousness with his knowledge also, is never
taken into account; and is slighted by all to be plunged into
insignificance and misery. (The unlearned virtuous, is as
despicable as the learned vicious).</p>

<p class='c009'>19. Again Sir;—it is the joint assent of men and the Veda,
that acts and their actors come one after the other; and not
as you said of their rising simultaneously from their divine
origin. (That is to say; that the morals established by the
wise, and the virtues inculcated by the holy scriptures, are
the guides of good acts and their observers, which are not the
spontaneous growth of our nature or intention).</p>

<p class='c009'>20. It is the act which makes the actor, and the actor who
does the work. Thus they follow one another on the analogy
of the seed and the tree which produce one another. This
mutuality of both is seen in the practice of men and
ordinances of the Veda.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. Acts are the causes of animal births, as the seed gives
birth to the sprouts of plants; and again works proceed from
living beings as the sprouts produce the seeds. (Thus both are
causes and effects of one another by turns, and never grown
together).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. The desire that prompts a person to his particular pursuit
in his prison house of this world, the same yields him the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>like fruits and no other. (Men get what they have in their
hearts and nothing besides).</p>

<p class='c009'>23. Such being the case, how was it sir, that you said of
the production of animals from the seed of Brahma, without
the causality of their prior acts, which you say to be
simultaneous with the birth of animal beings.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. On one hand you have set at naught the law of antecedence
and sequence of birth and action to one another, by your
position of their simultaneity.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. And again to say, that Brahma is not the origin of actions,
and that Brahmá and other living beings are subjected to their
several actions, are self contradictory propositions and
opposed to common sense. (For the acts do not originate
from Brahmá, they cannot be binding on others; and if the
actions do not proceed from that source, whence do they come
to take place). This question upsets the doctrine of Free Will.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. And also to say that living beings are born together with
their actions (by predestination), and are bound to them to no
purpose, would be to apply to them the analogy of fishes which
are caught by the baits they cannot devour, but cause their death.
(So men must be bound in vain to the baits of their actions,
if they are to go without reaping their fruition).</p>

<p class='c009'>27. Therefore please to tell me sir, about the nature of acts,
for you are best acquainted with the secrets of things, and
can well remove my doubts on the subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. Vasishtha replied:—You have well asked, my good Ráma!
about this intricate subject, which I will now explain
to you in a manner that will enlighten your understanding.</p>

<p class='c009'>29. It is the activity of the mind which forms its thoughts and
intentions, which are the roots or seed of actions; and it is
its passivity, which is the recipient of their results. (So says
the Sruti:—whatever is thought in the mind, the same is expressed
in words and done in action).</p>

<p class='c009'>30. Therefore no sooner did the principle of the mind spring
from the essence of Brahmá, than it was accompanied by its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>thoughts and actions in the bodies, which the living beings
assumed, according to their prior deserts and in-born desires.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. As there is no difference between the self-same flower
and its fragrance; in the same manner there is no distinction
of the mind, from its actions which are one and the same thing.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. It is the exertion of bodily activity, which we call an
action here; but it is well known to the wise to be preceded
by a mental action, which is called its thought in the mind:
(<i>chitta</i> of the <i>chit</i> or the thought of the thinking principle).</p>

<p class='c009'>33. It is possible to deny the existence of material objects,
of the air and water, the hill and others; but it is impossible
to deny the operations of our mental faculties, of which we
have subjective evidence in ourselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. No deliberate action of the present or past life goes for
nothing; all human actions and efforts are attended with their
just results, to which they are properly directed. (Sávadhánam
anushthitán).</p>

<p class='c009'>35. As the ink ceases to be ink, without its inky blackness,
so the mind ceases to exist, without the action of its mental
operations.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. Cessation of mental operation, is attended with desinence
of thought, and quiescence of the mind, is accompanied with
discontinuance of actions. The liberated are free from both
of these; but the unemancipate from neither. (<i>i.e.</i> The
liberated are devoid of the thoughts and actions, which are
concomitants with one another).</p>

<p class='c009'>37. The mind is ever united with its activity as the fire
with its heat, and the want of either of these, is attended
to worldlings with the extinction of both.</p>

<p class='c009'>38. The mind being ever restless in itself, becomes identified
with the actions proceeding from its activity. The actions
also whether good or bad, become identified with the mind,
which feels their just rewards and punishments. Hence you
see Ráma! The inseparable connection of the mind and acts,
in reciprocating their actions and reactions upon each other.</p>

Argument. The Faculties of the Mind, and
their Various Functions and appellations.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> said:—The mind is mere thought, and thought
is the mind in motion (literally, having the property of
fluctuation). Its actions are directed by the nature of the
thoughts (lit. according to the nature of the objects of thought);
and the result of the acts is felt by every body in his mind.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Ráma said:—Sir, I pray you will explain in length, regarding
the immaterial mind as opposed to the material body, and its
inseparable property of will or volition (contrary to the
inertness of dull matter).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Vasishtha replied:—The nature of the mind is known to be
composed of the property of Volition, which is an attribute
of the infinite and almighty power of the Supreme soul. (<i>i.e.</i>
The mind is the volitive principle of the soul).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. The mind is known to be of the form of that self-moving
principle, which determines the dubitation of men between the
affirmative and negative sides (as whether it is so or not
<i>dwikotika</i>). <i>i.e.</i> The principle of rationality or the Reasoning
faculty, consisting of the two great alternatives; <i>viz.</i> 1. The
principle of contradiction: or of two contradictory propositions
of which one is true, and the other untrue, <i>i.e.</i> Is, or, is not.
<i>2.</i> <i>Raison determinantic</i> or determining by <i>a priori</i> reasoning,
as, why so and not otherwise.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. The mind is known to be of the form of <i>Ego</i>, which is
ignorant of the self manifesting soul of God; and believes
itself as the subject of its thoughts and actions.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. The mind is of the nature of imagination (Kalpaná), which
is ever busy in its operations: hence the inactivity of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>mind is as impossible in this world, as the insapience of the
sapient man. (Imagination is an active faculty, representing
the phenomena of the internal and external worlds, Sir W.
Hamilton. It is an operation of the mind consisting of manifold
functions, such as;—1. of receiving by the faculty of conception.
2. of retaining by the faculty of memory. 3. of recalling by the
power of reproductive fancy; 4. of combining by productive fancy.
In modern philosophy, it is the <i>power of apprehending</i> ideas, and
combining them into new forms).</p>

<p class='c009'>7. As there is no difference in the essence of fire and heat; so
there is no difference whatever between mind and its activity,
and so betwixt the mind and soul (<i>i.e.</i> the living soul).</p>

<p class='c009'>8. The mind is known by many names in the same person and body,
according to its various faculties and functions, its various
thoughts and desires, and their manifold operations and consequences.
(The mind, soul and intellect taken together as the same thing,
comprise all the powers of intellect and intelligence).</p>

<p class='c009'>9. The Divine Mind is said to be distributed into all souls
by mistake and without any reason; since the All—<i>to pan</i> is
without any substance or substratum, and indivisible in its nature.
It is a mere fabrication of our desires and fancies to diversify it
in different persons. (The Divine mind being the <i>Anima mundi</i>,
contains all within itself, and having no container of it).</p>

<p class='c009'>10. Whoever has set his desire in any thing as if it were a
reality, finds the same to be attended with the like fruit as he
had expected of it. (It means either that Association of ideas in
the mind, introducing as by a chord; a train of kindred consecutive
ideas, which are realised by their constant repetition, or that
the primary desires of our nature, which are not factitious, but
rising from our constitutions, are soon satisfied).</p>

<p class='c009'>11. It is the movement of the mind, which is said and perceived
by us to be the source of our actions; and the actions of the
mind are as various as the branches, leaves and fruits of trees.
(So it is said, the tree of desire has the mind for its seed,
which gives force to the action of bodily organs, resembling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>its branches; and the activities of the body, are the causes
which fructify the tree of desire).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. Whatever is determined by the mind, is readily brought
into performance by the external organs of action (Karmendriya);
thus because the mind is the cause of action, it is identified
with the effect. (By the law of the similarity of the cause
and effect, in the growth of one seed from another. Or that
the efficient cause <i>a quo</i>, is the same with the final-<i>propte
 quod</i> by inversion of the causa cognoscendi—in the effect being
taken for the cause).</p>

<p class='c009'>13. The mind, understanding, egoism, intellect, action and
imagination, together with memory, or retentiveness, desire,
ignorance, exertion and memory, are all synonyms of the mind.
(The powers of the mind, constitute the mind itself).</p>

<p class='c009'>14. So also sensation, nature, delusion and actions, are words
applied to the mind for bewilderment of the understanding.
(Many words for the same thing, are misleading from its true
meaning).</p>

<p class='c009'>15. The simultaneous collision of many sensations (like the
Kákátáli sanyoga), diverts the mind from its clear sight of the
object of its thought, and causes it to turn about in many
ways.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. Ráma asked:—How is it Sir, that so many words with their
different significations, were invented to express the transcendent
cause of our consciousness (the mind), and heap them on the same
thing for our confusion only?</p>

<p class='c009'>17. Vasishtha replied:—As man began to lose sight of his
consciousness, and laboured under suppositions about his-self,
it was then that he found the mind to be the waking principle
within him. (<i>i.e.</i> It is after one has lost the knowledge of his
conscious soul, that he thinks himself to be composed of the
mind. Or it was after man’s degradation from his spiritual
nature, that he came to consider himself as an intellectual
being with no higher power than his mental faculties the <i>manas</i>;
(whence he derives his name as <i>man</i>, <i>mánava</i> or <i>manusha</i>)).</p>

<p class='c009'>18. When man after considering himself and other things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>comes to understand them in their true light; he is then said
to have his understanding—<i>buddhi</i>. (We understand with or by
means of reason, as we say—a proposition is right by its reasons
<i>hetuváda</i>; but not reason on any thing without understanding
it; as we cannot judge of a thing without knowing what it is).</p>

<p class='c009'>19. When man by false conception of himself, assumes a
personality to him by his pride, he is called an egoist, with the
principle of ego or egoism in him, causing his bondage on earth.
Absolute egoism is the doubting of every thing beside self-existence.
<i>Persona est rationalis naturae individua substantia.</i> Boethius.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. It is called thought which passes from one object to
another in quick succession, and like the whims of boys, shifts
from one thing to another without forming a right judgement
of any. (Thoughts are fickle and fleeting, and flying from one
subject to another, without dwelling long upon any).</p>

<p class='c009'>21. The mind is identified with acts, done by the exercise of
a power immanent in itself as the agent; and the result of the
actions, whether physical or moral, good or bad, recurs to the
mind in their effects. (The mind is the agent and recipient of
the effects of all its various internal and external actions,
such as right or wrong, virtuous or vicious, praiseworthy or
blamable, perfect or imperfect and the like).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. The mind is termed fancy for its holding fast on fleeting
phantasies by letting loose its solid and certain truths. It is
also the imagination, for giving various images or to the objects
of its desire—<i>ihita Kalpaná</i>. It is called <i>Kákatálíya Sanyoga</i> or
accidental assemblage of fancied objects. It is defined as the
agglutinative and associative power to collect materials for
imagination which builds up on them. (<i>Imaginari est quan rei
corporae figuram contemplari.</i> Descartes).</p>

<p class='c009'>23. The Memory or retention is that power of the mind, which retains
an image whether known or unknown before, as if it were a certainty
known already; and when it is attended with the effort of recalling
it to the mind, it is termed as remembrance or recollection. (Memory
is the storehouse of ideas preconceived or thought to be known before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>in the mind. Retention is the keeping of the ideas got from
sensation and reflection. Remembrance is the spontaneous act
of the mind; and recollection and reminiscence, are intentional
acts of the will. All these powers and acts of the mind, are
singly and collectively called the mind itself; as when I say,
I have got it in mind, I may mean, I have it in memory,
remembrance &amp;c. &amp;c.)</p>

<p class='c009'>24. The appetence which resides in the region of the mind,
for possession of the objects of past enjoyment; as also
the efforts of the mind for attainment of other things, are
called its desires. (Appetites or desires are—common to all, and
are sensitive and rational, irascible &amp;c. Vide Reed and Stewart.
The mind is the same as desire; as when I say, I have a mind
to do a thing, I mean, I have a desire to do it).</p>

<p class='c009'>25. When the mind’s clear sight of the light of the soul or
self, is obscured by the shadow of other gross things, which
appear to be real instead of the true spiritual, it is called
ignorance; and is another name of the deluded understanding.
(It is called <i>avidyá</i> or absence of <i>Vidyá</i> or knowledge of spiritual
truth. It becomes <i>Mahávidyá</i> or incorrigible or invincible
ignorance, when the manners and the mind are both vitiated by
falsehood and error).</p>

<p class='c009'>26. The next is doubt, which entraps the dubious mind in the
snare of scepticism, and tends to be the destruction of the soul,
by causing it to disbelieve and forget the supreme spirit. (To
the sceptic doubts for knowledge rise; but they give way before
the advance of spiritual light).</p>

<p class='c009'>27. The mind is called sensation, because all its actions of
hearing and feeling, of seeing and smelling, thinking and enjoying,
serve to delight the senses, which convey the impressions back to
the mind. (The doctrine that all knowledge is derived originally
from senses, holds the single fact of sensation as sufficient
for all mental phenomena. It is the philosophy of Condillac,
called Dirt philosophy by Fichte).</p>

<p class='c009'>28. The mind that views all the phenomena of nature in the
Supreme Spirit, and takes outward nature as a copy of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>eternal mind of God, is designated by the name of <i>nature</i>
itself. (Because God is the <i>Natura naturans</i> or the Author
of Nature; and the works of nature—matter and mind, are the
<i>Natura naturata</i>. Hence the mind knowing its own nature and
that of its cause, is said to be an union of both natures,
and is the personality of Brahmá the Demiurge, who is combined
of nature and mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>29. The mind is called máyá or magic, because it converts the
real into unreal, and the unreal into real. Thus showing the
realities as unrealities, and the <i>vice-versa</i> by turns. It is
termed error or mistake of our judgement, giving ascent to
what is untrue and the contrary. The causes of error are
said to be ignorance (avidyá) and passions (tamas).</p>

<p class='c009'>30. The sensible actions are seeing and hearing, feeling,
tasting and smelling, of the outward organs of sense; but the
mind is the cause both of these actions and their acts. (The
mind moves the organs to their actions, as also feels and
perceives their acts in itself).</p>

<p class='c009'>31. The intellect (chit) being bewildered in its view of the
intellectual world (chetyas), manifests itself in the form of the
mind, and becomes the subject of the various functions which
are attributed to it. (The intellect having lost its universality,
and the faculty of intellection or discernment of universal
propositions, falls into the faults of sensitivity and volition,
by employing itself to particular objects of sense and sensible
desires).</p>

<p class='c009'>32. Being changed into the category of the mind, the intellect
loses its original state of purity, and becomes subject to a
hundred desires of its own making (by its volitive faculty).</p>

<p class='c009'>33. Its abstract knowledge of general truths being shadowed by
its percipience of concrete and particular gross bodies, it comes
to the knowledge of numbers and parts, and is overwhelmed by
the multiplicity of its thoughts and the objects of its desires.
(<i>i.e.</i> Having lost the knowledge of the universal whole and
discrete numbers, the mind comes to know the concrete particulars
only).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>34. It is variously styled as the living principle and the
mind by most people on earth; but it is known as intellection
and understanding (chitta and buddhi) by the wise.</p>

<p class='c009'>35. The intellect being depraved by its falling off from the
sole supreme soul, is variously named by the learned according to
its successive phases and functions, owing to its being vitiated
by its various desires, and the variety of their objects.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. Ráma said:—O Sir! that art acquainted with all truths,
please tell me, whether the mind is a material or immaterial
thing, which I have not been able to ascertain as yet. (It is
said to be matter by materialists and as spirit by spiritualists).</p>

<p class='c009'>37. Vasishtha replied:—The mind, O Ráma! is neither a gross
substance nor an intelligent principle altogether: it is
originally as intelligent as the intellect; but being sullied
by the evils of the world and the passions and desires of the
body, it takes the name of the mind. (From its minding of many
things).</p>

<p class='c009'>38. The intellect (chit) which is the cause of the world, is
called the <i>chitta</i> or heart, when it is situated in the bosom
of sentient bodies, with all its affections and feelings (ávilám).
It then has a nature between goodness and badness (by reason
of its moral feelings and bad passions).</p>

<p class='c009'>39. When the heart remains without a certain and uniform fixity
to its purpose, and steadiness in its own nature, it feels all
the inner changes with the vicissitudes of the outer world, and
is as a reflector of the same. (The text says, the fluctuations
of the heart, cause the vicissitudes of the world. But how can
the heart be subjective, and the world the objective? Is the heart
author of its feelings without receiving them from without? Yes).</p>

<p class='c009'>40. The intellect hanging between its intelligence and gross
objects, takes the name of the mind, when it is vitiated by
its contact with outward objects.</p>

<p class='c009'>41. When the action of the Intellect or the faculty of intellection,
is vitiated by sensitivity, and becomes dull by reason of its
inward dross; it is then styled the mind, which is neither
a gross material thing, nor an intelligent spiritual principle.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>42. The intellectual principle is variously designated by
many such names, as the mind, the understanding, the <i>ego</i>,
and the living soul or principle of animation.</p>

<p class='c009'>43. The mind bears its different appellations according to
the variety of its functions; just as an actor in the theatre,
appears under different names and garbs of the dramatic personages
on the stage. (The world is a stage, where one man acts many parts.
Shakespeare).</p>

<p class='c009'>44. As a man passes under many titles, according to his various
occupations and professions; so the mind takes different
appellations according to the various operations of its nature.
(Thus one man is a scholar, a householder, an officer, a subject
and many others at once).</p>

<p class='c009'>45. Besides the names that I have mentioned regarding the
mind, the disputants in mental philosophy, have invented
many others agreeably to their diverse theories.</p>

<p class='c009'>46. They have attributed to the mind many designations,
according to the views in which they designed to exhibit its
nature; such as some calling it the intellect, another the
understanding, the sensation and so forth.</p>

<p class='c009'>47. One takes it as dull matter, and another as the living
principle; some one calls it the ego, while others apply the
term understanding to it. (As Manas or Manu is the father of and
of the same nature with all mankind; so is the mind <i>manas</i> or
<i>mens</i>, similar in its nature and names with every one and all
its operations).</p>

<p class='c009'>48. I have told you, Ráma that egoism, mind and the light of
understanding, together with the volition of creation, are
but different properties of the one and same internal principle.
(Ego—the subjective, mind—the motive, understanding—the thinking,
and the volitive powers, all relate to the same soul. All these
are different faculties having the one and same common root—the
one universal soul).</p>

<p class='c009'>49. The Nyáyá philosophy has taken the mind &amp;c., in different
lights according to its own view of them; and so the Sánkhya
system explains the perception and senses in a way peculiar to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>itself. (Namely: the Nyáyá says, the Ego to be a <i>dravya</i> or
substance; the living soul as God; the mind a sensitive particle
and internal organ; and understanding as a transitory
property of the mind. The Sánkhya has the understanding as
a product of matter, and egoism a resultant of the same, and
the mind as the eleventh organ of sense).</p>

<p class='c009'>50. In this manner are all these terms taken in very different
acceptations, by the different systems of Mímámsá, Vaiseshika,
Arhata and Buddhist philosophy. The Pancharátra and some other
systems, have given them particular senses disagreeing with
one another. (See Rákháldása Nyayaratna’s tract on the identity
of the mind and the soul <i>átmá</i>; and Hirálal’s reply to and
refutation of the same).</p>

<p class='c009'>51. All these various doctrines, arising at different times and
in distant countries, lead at last to the same supreme Being,
like the very many different ways, leading their passengers to the
same imperial city. (All systems of philosophy, like every scheme
of religion and its different sects and schisms, lead their followers
to the same truth of one Superintending power or Deity).</p>

<p class='c009'>52. It is ignorance of this supreme truth or misunderstanding of
the discordant doctrines, that causes the votaries of different
systems and sects, to carry on an endless dispute among
themselves with bitter acrimony. (All party contentions, are
but effects of ignorance of the various terminology bearing
the same sense).</p>

<p class='c009'>53. The disputants maintain their particular positions by
their respective dogmatism; just as passengers persist in
their accustomed paths as the best suited to them. (Bias has
a stronger basis in the mind and has a faster hold of the
human heart, than the best reason and the surest truth).</p>

<p class='c009'>54. They have spoken falsely, whose words point out every
thing as the fruit of our acts, and direct mankind only to the
performance of their actions. It is according to the various
prospects that men have in view, that they have given their
reasons in their own ways. (Ask of the learned, the learned
are blind, this bids you shun, and that to love mankind. Pope).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>55. The mind receives its various names from its different
functions as a man is called a <i>Snataka</i> or early bather, and
a <i>dátá</i>—donor, from his acts of sacred ablutions and
religious gifts.</p>

<p class='c009'>56. As the actor gets his many titles, according to the several
parts which he performs; so the mind takes the name of a Jíva
or living being, from its animation of the body and its
desires. (The mind is repeatedly said to be the animating
and volitive principle).</p>

<p class='c009'>57. The mind is said to be the heart also, which is perceived
by every body to reside within himself. A man without the
heart, has no feeling nor sensation.</p>

<p class='c009'>58. It is the heart which feels the inward pleasure or pain,
derived from the sight or touch, hearing or smelling, and
eating and drinking of pleasurable and painful things.</p>

<p class='c009'>59. As the light shows the colours of things to the sight,
so the mind is the organ, that reflects and shows the
sensations of all sensible objects in the cranium and
sensory.</p>

<p class='c009'>60. Know him as the dullest of beings, who thinks the mind to
be a dull material substance; and whose gross understanding
cannot understand the nature of the Intellect.</p>

<p class='c009'>61. The mind is neither intelligence (chetana) nor inert matter
(jada); it is the <i>ego</i> that has sprung amidst the various joys
and griefs in this world. (The pure intelligence knows no
pleasure nor pain; but the mind which is the same with the
conscious <i>ego</i>, is subjected to both in this world).</p>

<p class='c009'>62. The mind which is one with the divine Intellect (<i>i.e.</i>
sedately fixed in the one Brahmá), perceives the world to be
absorbed into itself; but being polluted with matter (like fresh
water with soil), it falls into the error of taking the world for
real. (The clear mind like clear water is unsullied with the soil
of the material world; but the vitiated mind, like foul water,
is full of the filth of worldliness).</p>

<p class='c009'>63. Know Ráma, that neither the pure immaterial intellect, nor
gross matter as the inert stone, can be the cause of the material
world. (The spirit cannot produce matter, nor can dull matter
be productive of itself).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>64. Know then, O Rághava, that neither intelligence nor inertia,
is the cause of the world; it is the mind that is the cause of
visible objects, as it is the light which unfolds them to the
view. (Intelligence is the knowledge of the self-evident, and
not their cause).</p>

<p class='c009'>65. For where there is no mind, there is no perception of the
outer world, nor does dull matter know of the existence of
anything; but everything is extinct with the extinction of the
mind. (A dead body like a dull block, is insensible of every thing).</p>

<p class='c009'>66. The mind has a multiplicity of synonyms, varied by its
multifarious avocations; as the one continuous duration undergoes
a hundred homonyms, by the variations of its times and seasons.</p>

<p class='c009'>67. If egoism is not granted to be a mental action, and the
sensations be reckoned as actions of the body; yet its name of
the living principle, answers for all the acts of the body and
mind. (Egoism or knowledge of the self, is attributed to the
soul by some schools of philosophy, and sensations are said to be
corporeal and nervous actions; yet the moving and animating
power of the mind, must account for all bodily and mental
actions.)</p>

<p class='c009'>68. Whatever varieties are mentioned of the mind, by the
reasonings of different systems of philosophy, and sometimes by
the advocates of an opinion, and at others by their adversaries:—</p>

<p class='c009'>69. They are neither intelligible nor distinguishable from
one another, except that they are all powers of the self-same
mind; which like the profluent sea, pours its waters into
innumerable outlets.</p>

<p class='c009'>70. As soon as men began to attribute materialistic powers
and force to the nature of the pure (immaterial) consciousness,
they fell into the error of these varieties of their own making.</p>

<p class='c009'>71. As the spider lets out its thread from itself, it is in the
same manner that the inert has sprung from the intellect, and
matter has come into existence from the ever active spirit
of Brahmá.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>(The Sruti says:—Every thing comes out of the spirit as the
thread from the spider, the hairs and nails from the animal
body, and as rocks and vegetables springing from the earth).</p>

<p class='c009'>72. It is ignorance (of the said Sruti), that has introduced
the various opinions concerning the essence of the mind; and
hence arose the various synonymous expressions, significant
of the Intellect among the opponents.</p>

<p class='c009'>73. The same pure Intellect, is brought to bear the different
designations of the mind, as understanding, living principle
and egoism; and the same is expressed in the world by the terms
intelligence, heart, animation and many other synonyms, which
being taken as expressive of the same thing, must put an end
to all dispute. (So all metaphysical disputes owe their origin
to the difference of terminology. Such as, Kant regarded the
mind under its true faculties of cognition, desire and moral
feeling, called as Erkenntnißvermögen or Denkvermögen,
Begehrungsvermögen, and Gefühlsvermögen. Instead of multiplying
the synonyms of Mind here, I refer the reader to Roget’s
Thesaurus for them).</p>

Argument. The Intellectual, Mental and Material
Spheres, and their representations in the Mind.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">R</span>áma</span> said:—I come to understand, O venerable sage! from
all you have propounded, that this grandeur of the universe
being the work of the Divine Mind, is all derived from the
same. (Here the creation of the world by the Divine mind, is
viewed in the pantheistic light of Emanation).
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Vasishtha answered:—The Mind as already said, having assumed
a substantial form, manifested itself in the form of water in
the mirage, raised by the shining blaze of its own light. (This
passage embodies both theories, that light was the first work of
God, and the Spirit of God moved on the surface of the waters.
<i>O ruh Eloim marhapeth-fi pene al maim.</i> Genesis.
<i>Apa eva Sasarjádan.</i> Manu).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. The mind became amalgamated (identic), with the contents
of the world, in the Spirit of Brahmá, now showing itself
in the form of man, and now appearing as a God. (<i>i.e.</i> the
mind reflected on these images which were evolution of itself
in itself; because the thought or product of the mind, was
of the same substance with itself). (This accords with the
pantheistic doctrine, that God and Nature are one substance,
and the one is a modification of the other).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Somewhere he showed himself as a demon and at another
place like a <i>yaksha</i> (yakka); here he was as a <i>Gandharvá</i>, and
there in the form of a <i>Kinnará</i>. (All these were the ideal
manifestations of the Divine Mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. The vast expanse of the Mind, was found to comprise in it
the various tracts of land; and the pictures of many cities and
habitable places. (Because the mind is the reservoir of all their
images).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>6. Such being the capacity of the mind, there is no reckoning
of the millions of bodies, which are contained in it, like the
woods and plants in a forest. All those are not worth our
consideration in our inquiry about the mind. (They are as
useless to the psychologist as botany is to the geologist).</p>

<p class='c009'>7. It was this mind which spread out the world with all its
contents, beside which there exists naught but the Supreme
Spirit. (The mind is the container of the archetypes of the
ectypal world, or the recording power of knowledge; but the
Supreme Soul is the disembodied self-consciousness, having the
principle of volition or Will; while the Spirit is the animating
faculty of the soul).</p>

<p class='c009'>8. The soul is beyond every category, it is omnipresent and
the substratum of all existence, and it is by the power of this
soul, that the mind doth move and manifest itself. (The mind
is the soul incorporated with bodies; but the soul is quite
apart from these).</p>

<p class='c009'>9. The Mind is known as the cause of the body, which is
work of the mind; it is born and becomes extinct with the
body, which the soul does not, nor has it any such quality
which belongs to the mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. The mind is found by right reasoning to be a perishable
object, and no sooner doth it perish, than the living soul
succeeds to obtain its final liberation. For the desires of
the mind are the bondage of its transmigration, but the
dissolution of the mind with its desires, secures its liberation.
(Volition and velleity, are the active and inactive acts of
the mind for its eternal bondage).</p>

<p class='c009'>11. After decadence of the mental desires there is no more any
exertion for acts. This state is called the liberation of living
souls, from their release from trouble and care; and the mind
thus released, never comes to be born and die again. (Free
from desire, is freedom from deadly sin).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. Ráma said:—Sir! You have said before, that human nature
is principally of three kinds viz:—the good, the gentle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>and the base (<i>Satva</i>, <i>rajas</i> and <i>tamas</i>); and it is owing to the good
or bad nature of their minds, that men differ from one another.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. Now please tell me, how could the wondrous mind originate
from the pure intellect with its good or bad propensities,
which are wanting in the Divine Intellect.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. Vasishtha replied:—Know Ráma, that there are three spheres
of the infinite vacuity, at immense distances from one another:
and these are the intellectual, mental, and the physical spheres.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. These spheres are common to all mankind, and are spread out
everywhere; and they have all sprung and come to being from the
essence of the <i>Chit</i> or Divine Intellect. (The first is the
space of Divine Infinity, the second is the <i>spatium dunamia</i> or
potential space and may be filled by bodies; and the third is
the place <i>energeia</i> or actually occupied by bodies).</p>

<p class='c009'>16. That space which is both in the inside and outside of
everything, and denotes its occupation or otherwise by some
substance or its absence, and pervades through all nature,
is called the inane sphere of the Intellect.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. That is called the sphere of the Intellect, which embraces
all space and time which has spread out the other spheres, and
which is the highest and best of all.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. The physical sphere contains all created beings, and extends
to the circuit of the ten sides, all about and above and below
us. It is a continued space filled with air, which supports
the clouds and waters above the firmament.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. Then the vacuity of the mental sphere, which has also sprung
from the intellectual sphere, has likewise the intellect for its
cause like the others, as the day is the source of all works and
animal activities. (Here the word works has the double sense
of the works of creation, which were made in the week days, and
the daily works of men and their religious duties, all which
are done in the day time. The night being the time to
sleep).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>20. The vitiated Intellect which views itself as a dull thing,
amidst the gross material objects of the physical sphere, the
same is termed the mind, which thinks of both spheres, whence
it is born and where it is placed.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. It is for the understanding of the unenlightened, that I have
made use of the metaphor of the spheres; because figures are used
for the instruction of the unenlightened and not to lighten the
enlightened. (These serve for ocular demonstrations in mathematical
and not in metaphysical sciences).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. In the intellectual sphere, you will see one Supreme
Brahma, filling its whole space, and being without parts
or attributes, and intelligible only to the enlightened.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. The ignorant require to be instructed in appropriate words
and precise language, showing the demarkation between monotheism
and ditheism, which is unnecessary for the instruction of the
enlightened.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. I have contrived to explain to you the nature of divine
knowledge, by the parable of the three spheres, which will
enlighten you as long as you are in dark on the subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. The intellectual sphere being obscured by ignorance,
we are led to look into the mental and physical spheres; not
knowing that they are as delusive as the sunbeams in a mirage,
and as destructive as the flames of a conflagration.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. The pure intellect being changed to the state of the
changeful mind, takes a debased figure; and then being
confounded in itself, weaves the magic web of the world
to entangle itself in the same.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c010'><sup>[10]</sup></a>27. The ignorant that are guided by the dictates of their
perverted minds, know nothing concerning the nature of the
Intellect, which is identic with the Supreme. So the witless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>that unwittingly take the white shells for bright silver, are
seen to labour under their delusion, until they are freed from
it, by the clear light of their understanding.</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. The wide extent of the Heart and its ultimate Dissolution.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hatever</span> may be the origin and nature of the human
heart (which some take for the mind), it should be always
inquired into in seeking out one’s own liberation. (The heart
called <i>antahkarana</i>—an inner organ, is often supposed as the
same with the mind; its cravings after worldliness, are to be
suppressed under its longing for liberation from worldly cares).
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. The heart being fixed in the Supreme, becomes purified
of its worldly desires and attachments; and then O Ráma!
it perceives that soul in itself, which transcends all
imaginations of the mind. (Kalpanás are imaginary attributes
of God in the mind; who can only be seen in the heart).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. It is the province of the heart, to secure the sedateness
of the world in itself; and it lies in the power of the heart,
either to make its bondage or get its freedom, from the desires
and troubles of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. On this subject there hangs a curious tale relating the
legend of the heart, which was revealed to me of yore by
Brahmá himself; and which I will now relate to you Ráma,
if you will listen to it with attention.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. There is a long, open and dreary desert, Rámátaví by name;
which was quite still and solitary and without an inhabitant,
in it; and so vast in its extent, as to make a pace of a
league of it. (Or rather to make a league of a pace of it).</p>

<p class='c009'>6. There stood a man of a terrific and gigantic figure in it,
with a sorrowful visage and troubled mind, and having a thousand
arms and a thousand eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. He held many clubs and maces in all his manifold arms,
with which he was striking his own back and breast, and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>running away in this direction and that (as if for fear of
being caught by some one).</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Then having struck himself fast and hard with his own
hands, he fled afar a hundred leagues for fear of being
laid hold by some body.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. Thus striking and crying and flying afar on all sides, he
became tired and spent, and lank in his legs and arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. He fell flat with his languid limbs in a large blind pit,
amidst the deep gloom of a dark night, and in the depth of a
dire dark cave (from which he could not rise).</p>

<p class='c009'>11. After the lapse of a long time, he scrambled out of the
pit with difficulty; and again continued to run away, and
strike himself with his own hands as before.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. He ran again a great way, till at last he fell upon a
thorny thicket of <i>Karanja</i> plants, which caught him as fast
in its brambles, as a moth or grasshopper is caught in a flame.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. He with much difficulty extricated himself from the
prickles of the <i>Karanja</i> furze; and began again to beat
himself as before, and run in his wonted course as usual.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. Having then gone a great way off from that place, he got
to a grove of plantain arbour under the cooling moonbeams,
where he sat for a while with a smiling countenance.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. Having then come out of the plantain grove, he went
on running and beating himself in his usual way.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. Going again a great way in his hurriedness, he fell down
again in a great and darksome ditch, by being exhausted in all
his limbs and his whole body.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. Rising from the ditch, he entered a plantain forest, and
coming out from that spot, he fell into another ditch and then
in another <i>Karanja</i> thicket.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. Thus he was falling into one ditch after rising from a
thorny furze, and repeatedly beating himself and crying in
secret.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. I beheld him going on in this way for a long time,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>and then I with all my force, rushed forward and stopped
him in his way.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. I asked him saying:—Who are you Sir, and why do you
act in this manner? What business have you in this place,
and why do you wail and trouble yourself for nothing?</p>

<p class='c009'>21. Being thus asked by me, O Ráma! he answered me
saying:—I am no body, O sage! nor do I do any such
thing as you are telling me about.</p>

<p class='c009'>22. I am here stricken by you, and you are my greatest
enemy; I am here beheld and persecuted by you, both to
my great sorrow and delight.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. Saying so, he looked sorrowfully into his bruised body
and limbs, and then cried aloud and wept a flood of tears,
which fell like a shower of rain on the forest ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. After a short while he ceased from his weeping, and
then looking at his limbs, he laughed and cried aloud in
his mirth.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. After his laughter and loud shouts were over, hear, O
Ráma! what the man next did before me. He began to tear
off and separate the members of his big body, and cast
them away on all sides.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. He first let fall his big head, and then his arms,
and afterwards his breast and then his belly also.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. Thus the man having severed the parts of his body one
after another, was now ready to remove himself elsewhere
with his legs only, by the decree of his destiny.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. After he had gone, there appeared another man to my
sight, of the same form and figure with the former one,
and striking his body himself as the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>29. He kept running with his big legs and outstretched
stout arms, until he fell into the pit, whence he rose
again, and betook to his flight as before.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. He fell into a pond again, and then rose and ran with
his body wringing with pain; falling again in hidden caves,
and then resorting to the cooling shade of forest trees.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>31. Now ailing and now regaling, and now torturing himself
with his own hands; and in this way I saw him for sometime
with horror and surprise in myself.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. I stopped him in his course, and asked about what
he was doing; to which he returned his crying and
laughter for his answers by turns.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. Finding at last his body and limbs decaying in their
strength, he thought upon the power of destiny, and the
state of human lot, and was prepared to depart.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. I came again to see another succeeding him in the same
desert path, who had been flying and torturing himself in
the same way as the others gone before him.</p>

<p class='c009'>35. He fell in the same dark pit in his flight, where I
stood long to witness his sad and fearful plight.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. Finding this wretched man not rising above the pit for
a long time, I advanced to raise him up, when I saw another
man following his footsteps.</p>

<p class='c009'>37. Seeing him of the same form, and hastening to his impending
fall in the doleful pit, I ran to stop his fate, by the same
query I made to the others before.</p>

<p class='c009'>38. But O lotus-eyed Ráma! the man paid no heed to my
question and only said, you must be a fool to know
nothing of me.</p>

<p class='c009'>39. You wicked Bráhman! he said to me, and went on in
his course; while I kept wandering in that dreadful
desert in my own way.</p>

<p class='c009'>40. I saw many such men coming one after the other to their
unavoidable ruin, and though I addressed to all and every
one of them, yet they softly glided away by me, like phantoms
in a dream.</p>

<p class='c009'>41. Some of them gave no heed to my saying, as a man pays
no attention to a dead body; and some among the pit-fallen
had the good fortune of rising again.</p>

<p class='c009'>42. Some among these had no egress from the plantain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>grove for a long while, and some were lost forever, amidst
the thorns and thistles of <i>Karanja</i> thickets.</p>

<p class='c009'>43. There were some pious persons among them, that had no
place for their abode; though that great desert was so very
extensive as I have told you already (and capable of affording
habitations for all and many more of them).</p>

<p class='c009'>44. This vast desert is still in existence, together with
these sorts of men therein; and that place is well known to you,
Ráma, as the common range of mankind. Don’t you remember it
now, with all the culture of your mind from your early youth?</p>

<p class='c009'>45. O that dreadful desert is this world, filled with thorns and
dangers on all sides. It is a dark desert amidst a thick spread
darkness, and no body that comes herein, finds the peace and quiet
of his heart, except such as have acquired the divine knowledge,
which makes it a rose garden to them. (See the pit-falls in the
bridge of Addison’s Vision of Mirza).</p>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">R</span>áma</span> said:—What is that great desert, Sir, and when was
it seen by me, and how came it to be known to me? What
were those men there, and what were they about?
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Vasishtha replied:—Attend O great-armed Ráma! and
I will tell you all:—</p>

<p class='c009'>That great desert is not distant nor different from this
wilderness of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. That which bears the name of the world, is a deep and
dark abyss in itself. Its hollowness is unfathomable and
unfordable; and its un-reality appearing as reality to the
ignorant, is to be known as the great desert spoken of before.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. The true reality is obtainable by the light of reason only,
and by the knowledge of one object alone. This one is full
without its union with any other, it is one and only by itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. The big bodied men, that you beheld wandering therein,
know them to be the minds of men, and bound to the miseries
of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Their observer was Reason personified in myself, and it
was I only and no other person, that could discern the folly
of their minds by my guiding reason.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. It is my business to awaken those drowsy minds to the
light of reason, as it is the work of the sun to open the
lotus-buds to bloom, by his enlivening rays.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. My counsels have prevailed on some minds and hearts,
which have received them with attention; and have turned them
away from earthly broils, to the way of true contentment and
tranquility.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>9. But there were others that paid no attention to my lectures
through their great ignorance; but fell down into the pit,
upon being chid by me with reproofs and rebukes.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. Those deep and dark pits were no other than the pits
of hell and the plantain groves of which I have told you,
were the gardens of Paradise.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. Know these to be the seats of those minds which long for
heavenly joys, and the dark pits to be the abode of hellish
hearts, which can never get their release from those darksome
dungeons.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. Those who having once entered the plantain grove, do
not come out any more from it; know them to be the minds of
the virtuous, and fraught with all their virtues.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. Those which having fallen into the <i>Karanja</i> thickets, were
unable to extricate themselves from the thorns; know them to
be the minds of men, that are entangled in the snares of the
world.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. Some minds which were enlightened with the knowledge of
truth, got released from the snares; but the unenlightened
are bound to repeated transmigrations in different births.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. The souls which are subjected to metempsychosis, have
their rise and fall in repetition, from higher to lower births,
and the <i>vice-versa</i> likewise.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. The thick thicket of <i>Karanja</i> brambles, represents the
bonds of conjugal and family relations; they are the source
of various human desires, which are springs of all other woe,
difficulty and dangers.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. The minds that have been confined in the <i>Karanja</i>
bushes are those, that are repeatedly born in human bodies,
and are repeatedly entangled into domestic attachments from
which all other animals are quite at large.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. O support of Raghu’s race! the plantain grove which
I told you was cooling with moonbeams; know the same to be
the refreshing arbour of heaven, which gives delight to the
soul.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>19. Those persons are placed here, who have their bodies
fraught with virtuous deeds and edified by persevering devotion
and austerities, and whose souls are elevated above others.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. Those ignorant, thoughtless and unmindful men, that
slighted my advice, were themselves slighted by their own minds,
which were deprived of the knowledge of their own souls and
of their reason.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. Those who told me, “we are undone at your sight, and
you are our greatest enemy”; were demented fools, and melting
away with their lamentations (for having disregarded my counsels).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. Those who were loudly wailing, and let fall a flood of
tears in their weeping; were men who bitterly deplored in their
minds for being snatched from the snare of pleasures, to which
they had been so fondly attached.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. Those having a little sense and reason, but not arriving
to the pure knowledge of God; were bitterly complaining in
their hearts, for being obliged to forsake their fond enjoyments
of life.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. Those who came to their understanding, now wept over the pains
which they had inflicted on their bodies, for the supportance
of their families; and were grieved in their minds to leave
behind the objects of their care, for whom they had taken
such pains.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. The minds that had some light of reason, and had not yet
arrived to divine knowledge, were still sorrowing for having
to leave behind their own bodies, wherein they had their late
abode.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. Those who smiled in the cheerfulness of their hearts,
were men who had come to the light of reason; and it was
their reason which gave consolation to their hearts.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. The reasonable soul that is removed from its bondage
of the world, exults with joy in its mind, to find itself
liberated from the cares of life.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. Those men who laughed to scorn their battered and shattered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>bodies, were glad to think in their minds, how they got
rid of the confines of their bodies and limbs, the
accomplices of their actions.</p>

<p class='c009'>29. Those who laughed with scorn to see the falling members
of their bodies, were glad to think in their minds, that they
were no better than instruments to their various labours in
the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. Those who had come to the light of reason, and had
found their rest in the supreme state of felicity, looked
down with scorn upon the former abodes of their meanness
from a distance.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. The man who was stopped by me on his way and asked with
concern (about what he was going to do); was made to understand
how the power of wisdom could outbrave the desperate.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. The weakened limbs, that gradually disappeared from
sight, meant the subjection of the members of the body, under
the control of the mind, that is freed from its venality of
riches.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. The man that is represented with a thousand arms and eyes,
is a symbol of the covetous mind, which looks to and longs
after everything, and wants to grasp all things, as with so
many hands. (The ambition of Alexander is described to count
the spheres, and grasp the earth and heaven in his arms).</p>

<p class='c009'>34. The man that was striking himself with his blows,
meant the torments which a man inflicts on his own mind,
by the strokes of his anxieties and cares.</p>

<p class='c009'>35. The man who had been running away with striking hard
blows upon his body, signified how the mind runs all about,
being lashed at every moment by the strokes of his insatiate
desires.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. The man that afflicts himself by his own desires, and then
flies to this way and that, signifies his fool-heartedness to
hunt after everything, and be a runaway from himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>37. Thus every man being harassed by his ceaseless desires,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>pants in his mind to fly to his Maker, and set his heart to
<i>yoga</i> meditation.</p>

<p class='c009'>38. All these ceaseless woes are the making of one’s own mind,
which being worried at last by its incessant anxieties, strives
to retire from them, to find its final repose in <i>yoga</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>39. The mind is entrapped in the net of its own wishes, as
the silk worm is entwined in the cocoon by the thread of its
own making.</p>

<p class='c009'>40. The more is the mind of man afflicted by troubles, the
more busily is it employed in its foibles; just as a boy indulges
himself in his playfulness, unmindful of the evils waiting upon it.</p>

<p class='c009'>41. The mind of man is in the same plight as that of the foolish
ape, which in striving to pull out the peg of a half split
timber, lost its life by the smashing of its testes in the
crevice. (See the story of the ape and its pulling the peg in
the Hitopadesa and its Persian version of the Anvarsoheli).</p>

<p class='c009'>42. No flight can release the mind, unless it is practised to
resignation, restrained from its other pursuits, and constrained to
the continued practice of pious meditation, which can only relieve
its sorrows.</p>

<p class='c009'>43. It is the misjudgment of the mind, that is the cause of
accumulated woes, which increase in height as the peak of a
mount; so it is the government of the mind which melts our
woes, like the hoarfrost under sunbeams.</p>

<p class='c009'>44. Accustom your mind to the righteous ways pointed out
by the sástras in all your life time. Restrain your appetites, and
govern your passions, and observe the taciturnity of holy saints
and sages. You will at last arrive to the holy state of holies,
and rest under the cooling umbrage of holiness, and shall no
more have to grieve under the calamities which betide all mankind.</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. Arguing the Omnipotence of the Deity from the powers
of the mind; and showing ignorance and knowledge to be the
different causes of Human bondage and liberation in life.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> continued:—I have told you of the origination of
the mind from the essence of the Supreme being; it is of
the same kind, and yet not the same with its source, but
like the waves and waters of the sea. (The mind being but
an attribute of the Divine soul).
 </p>

<p class='c009'>2. The minds of the enlightened are not different from the
Divine Mind; as those that have the knowledge of the community
of waters, do not regard the waves to differ from the waters of
the sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. The minds of the unenlightened are the causes of their
error, as those not knowing the common property of water,
find a difference in the waters of the waves and the sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. It is requisite for the instruction of the unlearned, to
acquaint them of the relation between the significant words and
their significations (as the relation of water between the waves
and the sea).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. The Supreme Brahma is omnipotent, and is full and perfect
and undecaying for ever. The mind has not the properties
that belong to the omnipresent soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. The Lord is almighty and omnipresent, and distributes his
all diffusive power, in proportion as he pleases to every one
he likes.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Observe Ráma, how the intellectual powers are distributed
in all animated bodies (in their due proportion); and how his
moving force is spread in the air, and his immobility rests
in the rocks and stones.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>8. His power of fluidity is deposited in the water, and his power
of inflammation is exhibited in fire; his vacuity is manifested
in vacuum, and his substantiality in all solid substances.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. The omnipotence of Brahma, is seen to stretch itself to
all the ten sides of the universe; his power of annihilation is
seen in the extinction of beings; and his punishment is evident,
in the sorrows of the miserable.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. His felicity is felt in the hearts of the holy, and his
prowess is seen in the persons of giants; his creative power is
known in the works of his creation, and his power of destruction
in the desolation of the world, at the end of the great Kalpa age.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. Everything is situated in Brahma, as the tree is contained
in the seed of the same kind, and afterwards developes in its
roots and sprouts, its leaves and branches, and finally in
its flowers and fruits.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. The power called the living principle, is a reflexion of
God, and is of a nature between the thinking mind and dull
matter, and is derived from Brahma.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. The nature of God is unchangeable, although it is usual to
attribute many varieties to him; as we call the same vegetable
by the different names of a germ, a sprout, a shrub, a plant
and a tree at its different stages of growth.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. Know Ráma, the whole world to be Brahma, who is
otherwise termed the Ego. He is the all pervading soul,
and the everlasting stupendous fabric of the cosmos.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. That property in him which has the power of thinking, is
termed the mind; which appears to be something other than the
Soul, thus we erroneously see peacock’s feathers in the sky,
and froths in the eddies of water (and suppose them as different
things from the sky and water).</p>

<p class='c009'>16. The principles of thought and animation—the mind and life,
are but partial reflexions of the Divine Soul; and the form of
mind is the faculty of thought, as that of life is the power of
animation. (The one is called the rational and the other animating
soul).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>17. Thus the mind being but the thinking power of Brahma,
receives the appellation of Brahmá; and this power appearing
as a part of the impersonal Brahma, is identified with Ego
(the personal Brahma).</p>

<p class='c009'>18. It is our error which makes a difference between the
soul and mind, and Brahma and Brahmá; because the properties
which belong to the mind, are the same with those of the
self-existent soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. That which is variously named as the principle of mind
or thought, is the same power of omnipotence which is settled
in the mind (which is the repository of the thinking powers).</p>

<p class='c009'>20. So are all the properties of the living soul, contained in and
derived from the universal soul of Brahma; as all the properties
of vegetation, blossoming and fructification of trees, are
contained in the season of spring, and are dispensed among the
plants, agreeably to their respective soil and climate, and other
circumstances (of their culture &amp;c.).</p>

<p class='c009'>21. As the earth yields its various fruits and flowers in their
season, so the hearts and minds of men, entertain their thoughts
and passions in their proper times: some appearing at one time
and others at another (like the paddies and other grains of
particular seasons).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. And as the earth produces its harvests, according to
their particular soil and season; so the heart and mind exhibit
their thoughts and feelings of their own accord, and not caused
by another.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. The numbers and forms which convey determinate ideas, as
distinguished from others of the same kind (as the figures in
arithmetic and geometry), are all expressed in words coined
by the mind from the mint of the mind of Brahma, the original
source of ideas.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. The mind adopts the same image as the reflexions which it
receives from without, or the thoughts and imaginations it forms
of itself, and as the instance of the Aindava brothers, serves to
support this truth (of the double power of intuition and perception
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>of the mind, to see into its own inner operations, and receive
the impressions from without).</p>

<p class='c009'>25. The animating principle (jíva-zoa), which is the cause of this
creation, resides in the Supreme Spirit, like the fluctuation
which is seen in the unagitated waters of the oceans.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. The intelligent soul sees these hosts of creation to be
moving in the essence of Brahma, as he beholds the innumerable
waves, billows and surges of the sea, rolling on the surface
of the waters.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. There is no other reality that bears a name or form or
figure or any action or motion except the supreme spirit;
in which all things move about as the waves of the sea water
(and which is the real source of the unreals).</p>

<p class='c009'>28. As the rising and falling and continuation and disappearance
of waves, occur on the surface of the sea by the fluctuation
of its waters; so the creation, sustentation and annihilation
of the universe, take place in Brahma, by the agency of Brahma
himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>29. It is by the inward heat of his spirit, that Brahma causes
this world to appear as a mirage in himself; and whatever varieties
it presents in its various scenes, they are all expansions and
manifestations of the Divine Spirit.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. All causality and instrumentality, and their resultants as
well as the production, continuance and destruction of all things;
take place in Brahma himself; beside which there is no other
cause whatever.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. There is no appetence nor pleasure, nor any desire or
error in him, who relies his dependence in the Supreme; for
how can one have any desire or error in himself who lives in
the Supreme self, who is devoid of them?</p>

<p class='c009'>32. The whole is a form of the Supreme soul, and all things
are but forms of the same; and the mind also is a form of it,
as a golden ornament is but a form of the gold.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. The mind which is ignorant of its Supreme origin, is
called the living soul; which from its ignorance of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>Supreme soul, resembles a friend who has alienated himself
from his true friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. The mind which is misled by its ignorance of the all-intelligent
God, to imagine its own personality as a reality; is as one who
believes his living soul to be the production of vacuum; (or as
something produced from nothing).</p>

<p class='c009'>35. The living soul although it is a particle of the Supreme
soul, shows itself in this world as no soul at all (but a form
of mere physical vitality). So the purblind see two moons in the
sky, and are unable to distinguish the true moon from the false
one.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. So the soul being the only real entity, it is improper to
speak of its bondage and liberation; and the imputation of error
to it, is quite absurd in the sight of lexicographers, who define
it as infallible.</p>

<p class='c009'>37. It is a wrong impression to speak of the bondage of the soul,
which is ever free from bonds; and so it is untrue to seek the
emancipation of the soul, which is always emancipate.</p>

<p class='c009'>38. Ráma asked:—The mind is known sometimes to arrive at a
certainty, which is changed to uncertainty at another; how
then do you say that the mind is not under the bondage of
error?</p>

<p class='c009'>39. Vasishtha answered:—It is a false conceit of the ignorant to
imagine its bondage; and their imagination of its emancipation,
is equally a false conception of theirs.</p>

<p class='c009'>40. It is ignorance of the <i>smriti sástra</i>, that causes one to
believe in his bondage and emancipation; while in reality there
are no such things as bondage and liberation.</p>

<p class='c009'>41. Imagination represents an unreality as reality, even to
men of enlightened understandings; as a rope presents the
appearance of a snake even to the wise.</p>

<p class='c009'>42. The wise man knows no bondage or liberation, nor any error
of any kind: all these three are only in the conceptions of
the ignorant.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>43. At first the mind and then its bondage and liberation, and
afterwards its creation of the unsubstantial material world,
are all but fabulous inventions that have come into vogue among
men, as the story of the boy of old (or as the old grand-mother’s
tale).</p>

<p class='c009'>Note—The conclusion of this chapter concerning the negation of
bondage and liberation of the soul, and its error and enlightenment
&amp;c., rests on the text of a Sruti; which negates everything in
the sight of one who has come to the light of the universal soul.

</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. The old Nurse’s tale of the three Princes or Powers
of the Soul, in elucidation of the Fabrications of Imagination.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">R</span>áma</span> said:—Relate to me, O chief of sages! the tale of the
boy, in illustration of the Mind (and the other principles
of our intellectual nature).
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Vasishtha replied:—Hear me Ráma, tell you the tale of a
silly and jolt-headed boy, who once asked his nurse, to
recite to him some pretty story for his amusement.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. The Nurse then began to relate her fine wrought story
for the pleasure of the boy, with a gladsome countenance,
and in accents sweet as honey.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. There were once on a time, some three highminded and
fortunate young princes; in a desolate country, who were
noted for their virtues and valour. (The three princes were
the three hypostases of the holy trinity, dwelling in the
land of inexistence or vacuity, <i>asat-pure</i>. <i>i.e.</i> These
triple powers were in being in empty space, which is
co-eternal with them).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. They shone in that vast desolate land resembling the spacious
sky, like stars in the expanse of the waters below. Two of
them were unbegotten and increate, and third was not born of
the mother’s womb. (These three uncreated princes, were the
principles of the soul and the mind, and the living soul—jíva,
which is not procreated in the womb with the body).</p>

<p class='c009'>6. It happened once on a time, that these three, started together
from their dreary abode (of vacuum), for the purpose of finding a
better habitation somewhere else. They had no other companion
with them, and were sorrowful in their minds, and melancholy in
their countenances; as if they were transported from their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span> native country. (This means the emigration of these principles,
from the eternal and inane sphere of Brahma, to the mundane
world of mortality, which was very painful to them).</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Having come out of that desert land, they set forth with
their faces looking forward; and proceeded onward like the
three planets Mercury, Venus and Jupiter in their conjunction.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Their bodies which were as delicate as <i>Sirísha</i> flowers,
were scorched by the powerful sun shining on their backs;
and they were dried like leaves of trees by the heat of the
summer day on their way. (<i>i.e.</i> Their tender spiritual bodies
melted under the heat of the solar world).</p>

<p class='c009'>9. Their lotus like feet were singed by the burning sands of
their desert path, and they cried aloud like some tender fawns,
going astray from their herd saying:—“O Father save us”. (The
alienated soul and mind, which are doomed to rove about in this
world are subjected to endless pains, causing them to cry out like
the tormented spirit of our Lord:—Eli Eli Lama Sabachthani;—Lord,
Lord, hast thou forsaken me?).</p>

<p class='c009'>10. The soles of their feet were bruised by the blades of grass,
and the joints of their bodies, were weakened by the heat of the
sun; while their fair forms were covered with dust flying from
the ground on their lonesome journey. (Their pilgrimage in the
thorny and sunny paths of the world of woes).</p>

<p class='c009'>11. They saw the clump of a leash of trees by the way side,
which were braided with tufts of spikes upon them, and loaded
with fruits and flowers hanging downward; while they formed
a resort for flights of the fowls of air, and flocks of the fauna;
of the desert, resting both above and around them. (The copse
of the three trees, means the triple states of <i>dharma</i>, <i>artha</i> and
<i>Káma</i>, or virtue, wealth and their fruition, which are sought
after by all).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. The two first of these trees did not grow of themselves,
(but were reared by men); and the third which was easy of ascent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>bore no seeds to produce other plants in future. (<i>i.e.</i> Virtue
and wealth require to thrive by cultivation, and enjoyment
which is delectable to taste, is not productive of any future
good or reward).</p>

<p class='c009'>13. They were refreshed from the fatigue of their journey,
under the shade of these trees; and they halted there like the
three Deities Indra, Váya and Yama, under the umbrage of the
Párijáta arbour of Paradise. (The three gods—Jupiter, Eolus and
Pluto, were the regents of the three regions of heaven, sky and
the infernal world:—<i>swar</i>, <i>bhuvar</i> and <i>bhur</i>, composing the three
spheres of their circuit).</p>

<p class='c009'>14. They eat the ambrosial fruits of these trees; and drank their
nectarious juice to their fill; and after decorating themselves
with <i>guluncha</i> chaplets, they retook themselves to their
journey. (<i>i.e.</i> The intellectual powers are supported by the
fruits of their acts in their journey through life).</p>

<p class='c009'>15. Having gone a long way, they met at the mid-day a confluence
of three rivers, running with its rapid currents and swelling
waves. (The three streams are the three qualities of <i>satva</i>,
<i>rajas</i> and <i>tamas</i> or of goodness, mediocrity and excess,
which are commingled in all the acts of mankind).</p>

<p class='c009'>16. One of these was a dry channel and the other two were shallow
and with little water in them; and they looked like the eyes of
blind men with their blinded eye-balls. (<i>i.e.</i> The channel of
<i>satva</i> or temperance was almost dried up, and that of <i>rajas</i>
or mediocrity had become shallow for want of righteous deeds;
but the stream of <i>tamas</i> or excess was in full force, owing
to the unrighteous conduct of men).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. The princes who were wet with perspiration, bathed
joyfully in the almost dried up channel; as when the three gods
Brahmá, Vishnu and Siva lave their sweating limbs, in the limpid
stream of Ganges. (The three powers of the soul, like the
three persons of the Puránic trinity, were respectively possessed
of the three qualities of action; and yet their pure natures
preferred to bathe in the pure stream of goodness—<i>satva</i>, as
in the holy waters of heavenly Ganga—the hallowed Mandákiní).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>18. They sported a long while in the water, and drank some
draughts of the same, which was as sweet as milk, and cheered
their spirits with full satisfaction of their hearts (meaning
that <i>satwika</i> or good conduct is sweeter far to the soul, than
any other done as unjust or showy—<i>rajas</i> or <i>tamas</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>19. They resumed their journey, and arrived at the end of the
day and about sunset, to their future abode of a new-built
city, standing afar as on the height of a hill. (This new-built
city was the new-made earth; to which the spirits descended
from their Empyrean).</p>

<p class='c009'>20. There were rows of flags fluttering like lotuses, in the
limpid lake of the azure sky; and the loud noise of the songs
of the citizens was heard at a distance.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. Here they saw three beautiful and goodly looking houses,
with turrets of gold and gems shining afar, like peaks of
mount Meru under the blazing sun. (These were the human
bodies, standing and walking upright upon the earth, and
decorated with crowns and coronets on their heads).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. Two of these were not the works of art, and the third
was without its foundation; and the three princes entered at last
into the last of these. (The two first were the bodies of men in
their states of sleep and deep sleep, called <i>swápa sopor</i> or
<i>swapnas-somnus</i> and <i>sushupti-hupnos</i> or <i>hypnotes</i>, which are inborn
in the soul; but it is the <i>jágrata</i> or waking body which is the
unstable work of art).</p>

<p class='c009'>23. They entered this house, and sat and walked about in
it with joyous countenances; and chanced to get three pots
as bright as gold therein.</p>

<p class='c009'>(These pots were the three sheaths of the soul, mind and of
the vital principle, called the <i> pránamáyá-kosha</i>).
24. The two first broke into pieces upon their lifting, and
the third was reduced to dust at its touch. The far sighted
princes however, took up the dust and made a new pot therewith?
It means, that though these sheaths are as volatile as air, yet
it is possible to employ the vital principle to action.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>25. Then these gluttonous princes cooked in it a large
quantity of corn for their food; amounting to a hundred
<i>dronas</i> minus one, for subsistence of their whole life-time.
(It means that the whole life-time of a hundred years, allotted
to man in the present age of the world, is employed in consuming
so many measures of food, except perhaps one <i>Drona</i>, which is
saved by his occasional fasts during his long life).</p>

<p class='c009'>26. The princes then invited three Bráhmans (childhood,
youth and age) to the fare prepared by them, two of whom
(childhood and youth) were bodiless; and the third (<i>i.e.</i>
old age) had no mouth wherewith to eat.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. The mouthless Bráhman took a hundred dronas of the rice
and eat it up, because he devoured the child and youth,
and the princes took the remainder of the Bráhman’s food
for their diet (which was nothing).</p>

<p class='c009'>28. The three princes having refreshed themselves with the
relics of the Bráhman’s food; took their rest in the same
house of their next abode, and then went out in their journey
of hunting after new abodes (or repeated transmigrations).</p>

<p class='c009'>29. Thus I have related to you, O Ráma! the whole of the
story of the boy and princes; now consider well its purport
in your mind, and you will become wise thereby.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. After the nurse had finished her relation of the pretty
parable, the boy seemed glad at what he had heard (though
it is plain without understanding its import).</p>

<p class='c009'>31. I have told you this story, O Ráma! in connection with
my lecture on the subject of the mind; and it will serve to
explain to you, the fabrication of the mind of this imaginary
being of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. This air-built castle of the world, which has come to be
taken for a reality, is like the story of the body, but a false
fabrication of the old nurse’s imagination. (Or old grand-mother’s
tale, and giving a name and form to an airy nothing).</p>

<p class='c009'>33. It is the representation of the various thoughts and ideas
of our minds, which exhibit themselves to view, according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>to the notions we have of them in our states of bondage and
liberation. (<i>i.e.</i> Our bondage to gross bodies, exhibits them in
their grosser form, and our liberation from the materialistic,
shows them in their subtile and immaterial shapes).</p>

<p class='c009'>34. Nothing is really existent except the creations of our
imagination, and it is our fancy which fashions all the objects
in their peculiar fantastic forms. (Everything appears to us as
we fancy it to be; whereby the same thing is viewed in a different
light, not only by different persons; but by the same
person in a different state of mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>35. The heavens, earth, sky and air, as also the rivers, mountains
and the sides and quarters of the sky, are all creations of our
fancy, like the visions in our dreams; which join and disjoin
and fashion the views in their phantastic forms. (Imagination
or phantasy, is a faculty representative of the phenomena of
internal or external worlds. Sir William Hamilton).</p>

<p class='c009'>36. As the princes, the rivers and the future city, were mere
creations of the nurse’s imagination, so the existence of the
visible world, is but a production of the imaginative power of
man. (The nurse’s representations of the princes &amp;c., were
rather the prosopopœia or personifications of her abstract
thoughts; as the material world is a manifestation of the ideal,
and called by the sufis <i>suwari manavi</i> and <i>suwari zahiri</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>37. The imaginative power manifests all things all around, as
the moving waters, show the rise and fall of the waves in the
sea. “It gives a shape of airy nothing”. “It is the power of
apprehending ideas and combining them into new forms and
assemblages”.</p>

<p class='c009'>38. It was this imaginative power of God, which raised the ideas
of things in his omniscient and all comprehensive soul; and these
ideals were afterwards manifested as real by his omnipotence;
just as things lying in the dark are brought to view by the
light of the day. (Imaginatio est rei corporae figuram contemplari.
Descartes and Addison. It is a lively conception of the objects
of sight. Reid. It recalls the ideas by its reproductive fancy,
and combines them by its productive power).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>39. Know hence, O Ráma! the whole universe to be the net-work
of imagination, and your fancy to be the most active power of
the mind. Therefore repress the thickening phantoms of your
fleeting fancy, and obtain your tranquility by your sole
reliance on the certainty of the immutable soul of souls.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Retire the world, shut out, imagination’s airy wings repress;
call thy thoughts home &amp;c.” Young’s Night thoughts.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER CII.<br> <br><span class="smcap">On the Indivisibility and Immortality of the Soul.</span><br></h2>
</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument:—Fallacy of Egoism, and Rational Investigation
into the nature of the Soul. The Means of curbing
Egotism, and the flight of Fancy.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> continued:—The ignorant are subject to errors
caused by their false fancies, from which the wise are entirely
free; and they by imagining and attributing perishable
properties to the imperishable soul, beguile themselves like
children, by taking their dolls for men. (It is the attributing
of sensible properties to the conscious soul).
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Ráma rejoined:—What is this perishable property, which
is imagined of and imputed to the imperishable soul? Tell me,
also O greatest of theologians! what is that misrepresentation,
which misleads the mind to the erroneous conception, of the
unreal world for a reality.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Vasishtha replied:—The soul by its continued association
with unreal and perishable things, thinks itself as one of
them, and takes upon it the title of an unreal and perishable
egoism, as a boy by association of his thoughts imagines a false
apparition to be a real ghost. (Egoism and tuism and suism,
means the personality or personal reality of the three persons
I, thou and this—aham, twam and sah, which in all systems of
mystic philosophy, is denied of all finite beings. The absolute
Ego is the supreme soul, and all other souls are but reflections
of it).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. All things being situated in one absolute reality, it is hard
to account for one’s personal egoism; and to say how and whence
this conception came to be in vogue. (The impersonal and
universal soul is the true Ego, and has no personal existence
what ever).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. In fact there is no egoism beside that of the supreme
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>soul; and yet is the nature of the injudicious to make a
difference of a finite and infinite Ego, and of a mortal
and immortal soul; as we see two streams of water in the
sun-beams in a sandy desert. (The human soul is no other,
than a particle of the supreme).</p>

<p class='c009'>6. The mind is a spacious mind (of richest gems) in this
extensive creation, and depends for its support on the supreme
soul; as the waves are dependent on the waters of the sea, for
their rise and subsistence. (The mind is the individual soul,
but the soul is the universal and undivided spirit and opposed
to the European doctrine of the minds being a generic and the
soul an individual name).</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Therefore give up, O Ráma! your erroneous view of the
reality of the world and your reliance on the baseless fabric
of the universe, and rely with delight on your judicious view
of the true substratum and support of all.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Inquire now into the nature of Truth, with a rational
understanding; and being freed from all error and bias,
discard all that is false and untrue.</p>

<p class='c009'>The idea of Tritheism and faith in the mystic number three,
is as deeply rooted in the Hindu mind, as we find it in the
Alexandrine triad of old, and the Trinity of modern Christians.
We have already given an ample exposition of the various
triads in Hindu theology and other sciences in our introduction
to this work (Vol. I. Sect XI. p. 61). Besides those we meet
herewith some other triads which are conveyed in the allegorical
story of the old nurse to her infant care for his early instruction,
though it is doubtful that the boy could either understand or
derive any benefit thereby. It will be worth while to mention
here the Alexandrian Triad of the three hypostases of the one
Being in the <i>psyche</i>—eternal soul, <i>nous</i>—the mind, and <i>Zoa</i>—Jíva—life
or activity. This last is the same with the <i>logos</i>—Word,
the manifestation of Divine power in whom there was
life also. Others formed their Triad of matter, soul and force,
as the three <i>principia</i> in nature. The Christian Trinity, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>some maintain as an imitation of the Alexandrians, presents
many differences respecting some portion of this doctrine, which
resulted in the heresies of Arianism, Sabellianism, Nestorianism
&amp;c. see further particulars on this head in Lewe’s History of
Philosophy, Vol. 1, p. 391.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. Why do you think the unconfined soul to be confined in the
body? It is vain to suppose the nature of the infinite soul,
to be confined in any place.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. To suppose the one as many, is to make a division of and
create a variety in the nature of the Supreme Spirit. Again
the Divine essence being diffused alike in all, it cannot be
said to be confined in one thing and absent in another.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. The body being hurt, the soul is supposed to be hurt
likewise; but no pain or hurt or sickness of any kind, can
appertain to the unchanging soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. The body being hurt or weakened or destroyed, there is no
injury done to the soul, as the bellows (of the blacksmith) being
burnt, the wind with which it was filled, escapes unconsumed.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. Whether the body lasts or falls, it is of no matter to us,
(since the soul survives its loss); as the flower being destroyed,
deposits its fragrance in the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. Let any pain or pleasure befall on the body, as dew-drops
falling on lotus-leaves: it can affect us no more than it is
for the fading lotus, to affect or afflict in any manner the
flying and aerial bee.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. Let the body rise or fall, or fly in smoke and mix with
the air; these changing forms of it, can have no effect
whatever on the soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. The connection of the body with the soul, is like that
between the cloud and the wind; and as that of the lotus with
the bee. (The former is moved and alighted upon by the latter,
and not that the latter is preserved by the former).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. If the mind which forms a part of all living bodies, is
not affected by bodily pain; how is it possible that the primary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>power of intellect which resides in the soul, shall ever be
subject to death?</p>

<p class='c009'>18. If you know, O wise Ráma, the soul to be indestructible
and inseparable (from any place or person), what cause then can
you have to sorrow for the supposed separation or disappearance
of the all-pervading spirit?</p>

<p class='c009'>19. After destruction of the body, the soul flies from it, to
abide in the infinite space of empty air; like the wind mixing
with the air after dispersion of the clouds, and the bee flying
to it after the lotus has faded away.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. The mind also is not relaxed with all its enjoyments of
life, unless it is burnt down by the knowledge of truth; why
then speak of the annihilation of the soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. The connection of the perishable body and imperishable soul,
is analogous to that of a vessel and the fruit it holds, and
of a pot and the air in it. (<i>i.e.</i> Of the container and the
contained; the frame-work is fragile, but its component is
infrangible).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. As a plum is held in the hand or it falls into a pit,
so the vacuous soul is reposed in or deposed from the body.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. As a pot being broken, its vacuous part mixes, with the
air; so the body being dissolved, the soul remains unhurt in
the empty space.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. The mind and body of living beings, are apt to disappear
at times from their habitations, and hide themselves under
the shroud of death; why then should we sorrow for such
renegades?</p>

<p class='c009'>25. Seeing the death and disappearance of others at all
times, no fool learns to think for himself, but fears to
die like all ignorant fools.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. Therefore renounce, O Ráma! Your selfish desires, and
know the falsity of egoism. Forsake the bond of the body
for flying upward, as a new fledged bird flies above, and
leaves its nest behind.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>27. It is an act of the mind, to lead us to good or evil; as
it is another function of it, to fabricate the false fabric
of the world like appearances in a dream.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. It is our incorrigible ignorance, that stretches out these
imageries for our misery only; and it is our imperfect knowledge,
which shows these false-hoods as realities unto us.</p>

<p class='c009'>29. It gives us a dim sight of things, as we view the sky
obscured by a mist; and it is the nature of the mind, to
have an erroneous view of objects.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. The dull and unreal world, appears as a reality to us; and
the imaginary duration of the universe, is as a protracted dream
in our sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. It is the thought or idea of the world, that is the cause
of its formal existence, as it is the blinking of the eye, that
shows a thousand disks of the sun and moon in the clear sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. Now Ráma, employ your reason to annihilate the formal
world from your mind, as the sun dissolves the snows by the
heat of his beams.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. As one wishing to overcome his cold, gets his object at
sunrise; so he who wishes to demolish his mind (its errors),
succeeds in it at the rise of his reason.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. As ignorance increases, so it introduces a train of impervious
errors and evils. It spreads a magic spell around it, as
Samvara the sorcerer showered a flux of gold dust about him.</p>

<p class='c009'>35. The mind makes the way to its own destruction by its
worldliness, and acts the part of its own catastrophe or
self destruction by all its acts.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. The mind cares only for keeping itself from destruction;
but it is a fool not to know beforehand its imminent death.</p>

<p class='c009'>37. The mind by its restless desires, hastens itself to a
painful death; which reasonable are trying to avoid; by their
government of the mind. (It is not right to trouble the mind
with worldly cares).</p>

<p class='c009'>38. The mind that is purified by reason, is purged from its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>volitions and nolitions; and resigns itself to the will of
the Divine soul, which is ever present before it.</p>

<p class='c009'>39. The curbing of the mind, is the magnanimity of soul,
and gives rise to liberation from pain, therefore try to
restrain your mind, and not to give a loose rein to it.</p>

<p class='c009'>40. The world is a vast wilderness, full of the forests of our
weal and woe, and beset by the dragons of disease and death on
all sides: the irrational mind is as the rampant lord of the
desert land, and drives us anon to all sorts of dangers and
difficulties.</p>

<p class='c009'>41. As the sage ended his sermon, the day departed to its
end; and the sun declined to the west to his evening service.
The assembly broke after mutual salutations, and met again and
greeted each other with the parting night and rising sun.
(This is the <i>Brahma muhúrta</i> or dawning day break at 4 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>)</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. The sufferings of men of ungovernable minds,
serving as a lesson towards the liberation of the wise.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">S</span>ome</span> minds are seen to break-forth in passions like the
torrents of oceans, and to heave and overflow on earth on
every side. (By the unrestrained rage of their appetites).
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. They reduce the great to lowness, and exalt the low also to
greatness; they make strangers of their friends, as also friends
to strangers. (Such is the changeful state of the human mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. The mind makes a mountain of a mote by its thought, and
thinks itself a lord with its little of a trifle. (These are
those that are puffed up with vanity. Falsus honor juvat,
non sed mendosum and mendacem. Horace).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. The mind being elated by the prosperity, which attends
upon it by the will of God, spreads a large establishment for a
while, and is then reduced to poverty in a moment at its loss.
(Fortuna nunquam perpetuo est bona:—Good luck lasts not for
ever. The highest spoke in fortune’s wheel, may soon turn
lowest. Fortuna transmutat incertos honores. Fortune is
ever shifting her uncertain favours).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Whatever things are seen in this world to be stationary or
changeful, are all but accidents according to the state of
viewing them in that light: Just as a passing vessel is thought
stationary by its passenger on board, but as moving by the
spectators on the shore.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. The mind is so changeful by the influence of time, place,
power and nature of acts and things, that it continually shuffles
from one feeling to another, like an actor personating his many
parts on the stage.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. It takes the truth for untruth and its reverse for certainty:
so it takes one thing for another, and its joy and grief are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>all of its own making. (<i>i.e.</i> The creations of its imagination).</p>

<p class='c009'>8. The fickle mind gets every thing according to its own
doing, and all the actions of our hands, feet and other members
of the body, are regulated by the same. (The mind is the
mover of bodily organs).</p>

<p class='c009'>9. Hence it is the mind that reaps the rewards of good or
evil according to its past acts; just as the tree bears its
fruits, according as it is pruned and watered in time. (Reap
as you sow).</p>

<p class='c009'>10. As the child makes a variety of his toy dolls at home
from clay, so the mind is the maker of all its good and bad
chances, according to the merit or demerit of its past actions.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. Therefore the mind which is situated in the earthen
dolls of human bodies, can do nothing of its own will, unless
it is destined so by virtue of its former acts. (The mind that
moves the body, is itself moved by the destiny derived from its
prior acts).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. As the seasons cause the changes in trees, so the mind
makes differences in the dispositions of living beings. (As
many men so many minds, and hard to have two men of one mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>13. The mind indulges in its sport of deeming a span as a
league, and <i>vice-versa</i> of thinking a long as short,
as in the case of the operations of our dreams and fancy.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. A Kalpa age is shortened to a moment, and so is a moment
prolonged to a Kalpa, by the different modes of the mind;
which is the regulator both of the duration and distance
of time and place.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. The perceptions of the quickness and slowness of motion, and
of much or little in quantity, as also of swiftness or tardiness
of time, belong to the mind and not to the dull material body
(though these sensations are derived by means of the bodily organs).</p>

<p class='c009'>16. So the feelings of sickness and error and of dolor and
danger, and the passing of time and distance of place, all rise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>in the mind like the leaves and branches of trees. (From its
inborn perceptions of them).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. The mind is the cause of all its feelings, as water is the
cause of the sea, and the heat of fire. Hence the mind is the
source of all things, and intimately connected with whatever
is existent in the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. The thoughts that we have of the agent, effect and
instrument of things, as also of the viewer, view and the
instrumentality of sight, all belong to the mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. The mind alone is perceived to be in existence in the world;
and its representations of the forests and all other things are
but variations of itself! So the thinking man sees the substance
of gold only, in all its various formations of bangles and
bracelets, which are taken for naught. (All objectivity is
dependant on the subjective mind, as there is no perception of
an object independent of the mind. See identity of the subjective
and objective in the Pantheistic Idealism of Spinoza).</p>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> said:—Hear me relate to you Ráma a very pretty
narrative, representing the world as an enchanted city,
stretched out by magic of the magician Mind.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. There lies on the surface of this earth a large and
populous tract of land by name of Northern Pándava, a
country full of forests of various kinds. (We know the
Northern Kuru the Uttara Kuru or Otterokoros of Ptolemy,
to be the Trans-Himalayan Tartary, which is here termed
the North-Pándava, from the King Pandu’s rambles and the
wanderings of the Pándava princes in it in their exile).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. The forests were deep and dense, and there dwell in the
fastness of these woods a number of holy hermits; while the
Vidyádhara damsels had wrought there many a bower of swinging
creepers (for their amusement).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Heaps of rubicund farina, wafted by the breeze from full
blown lotuses, rose as high as crimson hills on the ground;
which was decorated with wreaths and garlands by the loads of
flowers, which had fallen thereon from the surrounding trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Groves of Karanja plants were decorated with bundles of
blossoms, to the utmost boundaries of the jungle; and the
firmament resounded with the rustling noise, emitted by the
leafy date trees in the villages around.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. There was a range of tawny rocks on one side, and fields
brown with ripened corn on another; while the warbling of
cerulean doves re-echoed in the resonant groves about.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. The shrill cry of the stork resounded in the forest, and
the branches of tamala and pátali flowers, hang down like
ear-rings of the hills.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>8. Flocks of various birds, were making a chorus with their
vocal music; and the blooming crimson blossoms of páribhadra
arbors, were hanging over the banks, all along the length of
the running streams.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. Damsels in the cornfields, were exciting the passion of
love with their vocal music; and the breezes blowing amidst
forests of fruits and flowers, dropped down the blossoms in
copious showers.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. The birds, Siddhas and seers were sitting and singing
outside their homes of mountain caverns; and made the valley
symphonious with their celestial strains of holy hymns.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. The Kinnara and Gandharva concerts, were singing under
their bowers of plantain trees; and the greyish and gaysome
groves of flowers, were filled with the hum of the whistling
breeze.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. The lord of this romantic country, was the virtuous
Lavana, a descendant of king Harish Chandra; and as glorious
as his sire the sun upon earth. (This prince had descended of
the solar race).</p>

<p class='c009'>13. His fair fame formed a white diadem to crown his head,
and adorn his shoulders with its brightness; it whitened the
hills in the form of so many Sivas, besmeared with the hoary
ashes upon his tufted head and person.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. His sword had made an end of all his enemies; who trembled
as in a fit of fever on the hearing of his august name.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. His greatest exertion was devoted to the supportance to
respectable men; and his name was uttered like that of Hari
by all his people.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. The Apsara fairies sang with glee the songs of his praise,
sitting in the celestial seats of the gods on the tops of the
Himalayan mountains.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. The regent of the skies heard with attention, the songs of
the heavenly maids, and the aerial swans and cranes of Brahmá,
were responsive to their eulogies with their gabbling cries.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>(<i>Dhani</i> is the enharmonic diapason of Indian music).</p>

<p class='c009'>18. His uncommonly magnanimous and wonderous acts, which
were free from the fault of niggardliness; were unlike to
any thing that was ever heard or seen by any body.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. His nature knew no wiliness, and it was a perfect stranger
to pride and arrogance; he kept himself steadfast to his
magnanimity, as Brahmá held himself fast to his rudráksha
beads.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. He used to take his seat in the royal throne amidst his
courtiers, as the lord of the day occupies his seat in the sky
for the eight parts (watches) of the day. (The Ritual day is
divided into eight <i>yamárdha</i> parts for particular rites
and duties).</p>

<p class='c009'>21. After he was seated there as gladly as the moon in the
firmament, his chieftains and legions appeared before the
throne with their salutations (and presenting of arms).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. Then as the royal party was seated in the court-hall,
beautiful songstresses (that were in attendance), began to sing,
and ravish the hearts of the hearers, with the music of lutes.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. Then a set of handsome maids, waved the beautiful chouries
which they held in their hands, over the person of the king:
and the ministers and counsellors, as wise as the preceptors
of the gods and demons (Vrihaspati and Sukra), took their seats
beside him.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. The ministers were then employed in the public affairs
pending before them; and the dextrous officers were engaged
in relating the reports of the country to the king.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. There were the learned pandits reciting the holy legends
from their books, and the courteous panegyrists chaunting
their sacred eulogies on one side.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. There appeared at this time a magician in his fantastic
attire, and with his blustering vauntings before the Court; in
the manner of a roaring cloud, threatening to deluge the earth
with his showers of rain.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>27. He bowed down to the ruler of the earth, and lowly bent
his capped head and neck before the court; as a tree hangs
down its loads of fruits, at the foot of a mountain.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. He approached before the king, as a monkey advances to a
shady and lofty tree, loaded with fruits and flowers. (The
artful sorcerer is compared with the cunning monkey prying
into a fruitful arbour).</p>

<p class='c009'>29. The flippant brat then conveyed the fragrance of his
sense, with the breath of his mouth; and addressed the lofty
headed king with his sweet voice, as the humble bee hums to
the lotus.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. Reign O lord! that sittest on the earthly throne like the
moon enthroned on high, to mark one wonderful feat of my art,
known as the trick of Kharolikiká.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. Saying so, he began to twirl about his magic staff set
with peacocks’ feathers, which began to display many wonders
like the wonderful works of creation.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. The king beheld it describing a bright circlet, emitting
the particles of its rays around; and viewed in the manner, that
the god Indra views his variegated rainbow sparkling afar in the
sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. As this time a chieftain of Sinde (who was the master
of horse,) entered the court, as a cloud appears in the
starry heaven.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. He was followed by his swift and beautiful courser, as
the <i>Uchcha Sravá</i> horse of Indra follows his master in the
celestial regions. (This is the Pegasus of the Hindus).</p>

<p class='c009'>35. The chieftain brought the horse before the king and said
this horse my lord! is a match for the <i>Uchcha Sravá</i>, who was
produced from the milky ocean, and flies with the swiftness of
the mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. This horse of mine, O king of the earth! is the best of his
kind, and a compeer of Uchcha Sravás; he is a personification
of the wind in the swiftness of his flight.</p>

<p class='c009'>37. My master has made a present of this horse to you, my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>lord; because the best of things is a suitable present to
the best of men. (Great gifts are for the great; or, a donum
worthy of the donor and donee).</p>

<p class='c009'>38. After he had ended his speech the magician spoke in a
voice, as sweet as that of the swallow, after the roaring
of the cloud is hushed to silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>39. Do you my lord ride upon this horse, and wander at your
pleasure with full lustre on earth; as the sun shines forth
in splendour by his revolving round the heavens.</p>

<p class='c009'>40. Hearing this the king looked at the horse, and ordered
him to be brought before him, in a voice like that of the
peacock answering the roaring cloud.</p>

<p class='c009'>41. The king saw the horse brought before him as a figure
drawn in painting, and gazed upon him with his fixed eyes
and without closing his eye-lids, as he was himself turned
to a painting. (A gift horse is looked in his gait, and not
in his mouth).</p>

<p class='c009'>42. Having looked upon him for a long time, he mounted on his
back, and sat still with his closed eye-lids, as the sage
Agastya was confounded at the sight of the sea and its rocks.</p>

<p class='c009'>43. He continued for a couple of hours as if he was drowned
in his meditation, and as insensible saints remain in the
enjoyment of their internal and spiritual stupor.</p>

<p class='c009'>44. He remained as spell-bound and overpowered by his own
might, and could not be roused from his stupefaction by any
body, but was absorbed in some thoughts of his own mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>45. The flapping chouries ceased to wave about his person,
and the holders of the flappers remained as still as the
moon beams at night.</p>

<p class='c009'>46. The Courtiers remained motionless at seeing his quiescence,
as when the filaments of the lotus, remain unmoved, by their
being besmeared in the mud.</p>

<p class='c009'>47. The noise of the people in the Courtyard, was all hushed
and quiet; as the roaring of the clouds is stopped at the end
of the rains.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>48. The ministers were drowned in their thoughtfulness and
doubts at the state of their king, as the host of the gods were
filled with anxiety on seeing the club bearing Vishnu fighting
with the demons.</p>

<p class='c009'>49. The people were struck with terror and dismay, at seeing
this apoplexy of their prince who remained with his closed
eyes, like closed lotuses shorn of their beauty.</p>

Argument. Inquiry of the courtiers into the cause
of the king’s apoplexy, and his answer thereto.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> continued:—After a couple of hours the king
returned to his senses, like the lotus flower resuming
its beauty, after the mists of the rainy weather are over.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. He shook his body decorated with ornaments upon his
seat; as a mountain shakes with its peaks and woods at
an earthquake.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. His seat also shook under him as he came to his sense and
moved his body, just as the seat of Siva on the Kailása
mountain, is shaken by the movement of the infernal elephant.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. As he was about to fall down from the horseback, he was
held up by and supported upon the arms of his attendants; as
the mount Meru is kept from falling, by the hills at its feet
and sides.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. The attendants bore the prince, in the deranged state of
his mind upon their arms; as the still waters of the sea bear
the figure of the moon that is disturbed by the waves.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. The king asked them softly saying, what place was it and
whose court it was; as the bee shut up in the flower cup of
the lotus, asked it when it is about to sink in the water
saying:—Ah! where am I, and where am I going?</p>

<p class='c009'>7. The Courtiers then respectfully asked the king, what was
the matter with him; with a voice as sweet as the lotus utters
to the sun when he is eclipsed by Ráhu.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. The attendants also with all the ministerial officers, asked
him about his case; as the gods terrified at the great deluge,
asked the sage Márkandeya concerning the occurrence.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. Lord! we were greatly dismayed, said they, upon seeing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>you in that plight; because the stoutest hearts are broken
by accidents proceeding from unknown causes.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. What were those pleasant objects of your desire, that
had so much bewitched your mind? Since you know that all the
objects which appear pleasant for the present, prove to be bitter
at the end. <i>Gaudia principium nostri sunt saepe doloris.</i> Ovid.
Pleasure is often the introduction to pain, and amid the roses
fierce Repentence rears her snaky crest. Thomson. So: Pleasure
is pain, when drunk without a rein.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. How could your clear understanding, which has been pacified
by the grand doctrines and precepts of the wise, fall in to the
false fascinations of the foolish? (<i>Falsum gaudium juvat, quem
nisi mendosum.</i> False pleasure pleases, none but the base).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. The minds of fools are fascinated by the trivial and tawdry
trifles of common people; but they are of no value to the high
minded as one like yourself. (The good and great are above the
reach of the allurements of pleasure).</p>

<p class='c009'>13. Those who are elated by the pride of their bodies, have
their minds always excited by ungovernable passions, which
take their lead through life. (Pride is innate in beauty).</p>

<p class='c009'>14. Your mind is elevated above common things, it is calm and
quiet and enlightened by truth; and fraught with excellent
qualities; yet it is strange to find it out of its wits.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. The mind unpracticed to reasoning, is led away by the
currents of time and place, but the nobleminded are not
subject to the influence of incantations and enchanting spells.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. It is impossible for the reasoning mind to be weakened
or deranged, the high mind like the mount towering of Meru,
is not to be shaken by the boisterous winds.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. Thus consoled by his companions, the countenance of the
king resumed its colour; as the face of the full moon collects
its brightness, in the bright fortnight of the month.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. The moon-like face of the king was brightened by his full
open eyes, as the vernal season is beautified by the blooming
blossoms, after the winter frost has passed away.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>19. The king’s face shone forth with astonishment, and it was
mixed with fear, at the remembrance of the charm of the magician;
as the moon shines pale in the sky, after her deliverance from
the shadow of an eclipse.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. He saw the magician and said to him with a smile, as the
serpent <i>takshaka</i> addresses his enemy—the weasel.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. You trickster, said he, what was this snare which thou
didst entrap me in, and how was it that thou didst perturb my
tranquil soul by thy wily trick, as a gale disturbs the calm
of the sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>22. How wonderful are the captivating powers of spells, which
they have derived from the Lord, and whose influence had
overpowered on the strongest sense of my mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. What are these bodies of men, that are subject to death
and disease and what are our minds that are so susceptible
of errors, and lead us to continued dangers.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. The mind residing in the body, may be fraught with the
highest knowledge, and yet the minds of the wisest of men,
are liable to errors and illusion. (<i>Hominis est errare.</i> To
err is human).</p>

<p class='c009'>25. Hear ye courtiers! the wonderful tale of the adventures,
which I passed through under this sorcery, from the moment
that I had met this magician at first.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. I have seen so many passing scenes in one single moment
under this wizard, as had been shown of old by Brahma in his
destruction of the theurgy of Indra. (The mighty Sakra spread
his Indrajála or the web of his sorcery, in order to frustrate
the attempts of the valiant Bali against him, and was at last
foiled himself by the Brahma vidyá of Brahmá).</p>

<p class='c009'>27. Having said so, the king began to relate smilingly to his
courtiers, the strange wonders which he had beheld in his
state of hallucination.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. The king said:—I beheld a region full with objects of
various kinds, such as rivers and lakes, cities and mountains,
with many boundary hills, and the ocean girding the earth
around.</p>

Argument. The king borne on horse-back to the habitation
of a huntsman and was there married to his maiden daughter.
(This adventure resembles that of Tajul Maluk in Gule Bákavli.)
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> king related:—This land of mine abounding in forests and
rivulets, and appearing as the miniature of this orb of the
earth. Literally:—as the younger twin sister of the earth:—
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. This land appearing as the paradise of Indra, of which
I am the king, and where I am now sitting in my court-hall,
amidst my courtiers and all these citizens.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. There appeared here yonder sorcerer from a distant country,
like a demon rising from the infernal region on the surface
of the ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. He turned round his magic-wand emitting its radiance
around, as the tempest rends and scatters the rainbow of
Indra in fragments in the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. I was looking intently at the whirling wand, and the
horse standing before me, and then mounted on the back
of the steed in the dizziness of my mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. I sat on the back of this unmoving horse and seemed to
ride on a fleet steed, with the swiftness of the Pushkara and
Ávartaka clouds, riding over the tops of immovable rocks.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. I then went to a chase in full speed, a pass over an
ownerless desert, howling as the surges of the boundless
ocean.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. I was borne afterwards with the horse in the air, as if
we were wafted by the winds; and dashed onward like common
people, who are carried afar by the current of the insatiable
desires of their minds.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>9. Being then fatigued with my journey, and moving slowly with
my wearied horse, I reached to the skirt of the desert which
was as vacant as the mind of a pauper, and as empty as the
heart of a woman. (Cares hover over roofs of wealth, and
secrets from female hearts fly by stealth. <i>Curae laqueata circum
Tecta volantes.</i> Hor. Cares that flutter bat-like round fretted
roofs. A woman is never so weak as in keeping her secrets).</p>

<p class='c009'>10. It was as the wilderness of the world burnt down by a
conflagration, and without even a bird flying over it. It was
as a waste of sandy frost, and without a tree or any water in
it. (A vast desert displayed its barren waste).</p>

<p class='c009'>11. It appeared as another sky in its extent, and as the eighth
ocean of the world. It was as a sea on earth with its bed entirely
dried up. (There are in all only seven oceans in Indian Geography,
the eighth is a myth).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. It was as expanded as the mind of a wise man, and as
furious as the rage of the ignorant. There was no trace of
human feet, nor track with any grass or herb in it.
(Immeasurable and fathomless as the sapient mind.)</p>

<p class='c009'>13. My mind was bewildered in this boundless desert, like
that of a woman fallen into adversity, and having no friend or
food or fruit for her supportance. (Adversity is the canker of
the woman’s breast: <i>asaubhagyan jvarástrínám</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>14. The face of the sky was washed by the waters, appearing
in the mirage of the sandy desert; and I passed panting in
that dreary spot until it was sunset.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. It was with great pain and sorrow, that I passed across
that vast desert; like the wise man who goes across this
world, which is all hollow and void within.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. After passing this desert, I met a thick forest beyond
it, when the sun was setting in his setting mountain with his
horse, and tired with traversing through the hollow sphere of
heaven.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. Here the birds were warbling amidst the <i>jámb</i> and
<i>kadamba</i> trees, and were the only friends that the weary
travellers could meet with, in their weary and lonesome journey.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>18. Here detached plots of long grass, were seen waving
their tops; like covetous men nodding their heads, on finding
some riches to their heart’s content. (The poor are pleased
with a little, and bow down their heads at petty pittances).</p>

<p class='c009'>19. This shady forest afforded me a little joy, after my pains
in the dry and dreary desert; as a lingering disease seems more
desirable to men, than the pains attending on death.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. I then got under the shade of <i>Jambíra</i> tree, and felt
myself as pleased, as when the sage Markandeya got upon the
top of the mountain at the great deluge. (The Ararat of Noah?).</p>

<p class='c009'>21. Then I took shelter under the creepers, descending from its
branches, as the scorching top of a mount, finds a temporary
shadow under the umbrage of a dark cloud.</p>

<p class='c009'>22. As I was hanging down with holding the pendant roots
in my hand, the horse slided away from underneath me, as the
sins of a man glide under him, that puts his trust in the sacred
Ganges streams. (The purificatory power of Ganges water, resides
even in the belief of its holiness, and does not consist only in
bathing in it).</p>

<p class='c009'>23. Fatigued with my travel of the live-long day in the dreary
waste, I took my refuge under this tree; as a traveller rests
under the shelter of a kalpa tree at the setting of the sun.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. All this business of the world was stopped, as the sun went
down to rest in the western hills. (The Hindu ritual prescribing
no duty for the night consisting of three watches—<i>triyama
rajaní</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>25. As the shade of night overspread the bosom of the
universe, the whole forest below betook itself to its nightly
rest and silence. (The vegetable creation was known to sleep
at night by the Hindu sages).</p>

<p class='c009'>26. I reposed myself in the grassy hollow of a branch of that
tree, and rested my head on the mossy bed like a bird in its
nest. (Primeval men slept in the hollow of trees like birds,
for fear of rapacious animals in the caves of the earth below,
as also in the caverns of upland hills and mountains).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>27. I remained there as insensible as one bitten by a snake,
and as a dead body that has lost its past remembrance. (Sleep
and death are akin to each other—<i>hypnos kai thanatos didumo
adelpho</i>). I was as impotent as a sold slave; and as helpless
as one fallen in a dark ditch or blind pit. Bought slaves <i>krita-dásas</i>
and their loss of liberty, were in vogue from the earliest
times in India. (अन्ध कुप-अन्ध-कुया = a blind pit).</p>

<p class='c009'>28. I passed that one night as a long Kalpa in my senselessness;
and I thought I was buffeting in the waves like the seer—Markandeya
at the great deluge. (<i>i.e.</i> The body was insensible in the state
of sleep; but the mind was active as in a dream, which makes an
age of a moment).</p>

<p class='c009'>29. I passed the night under a train of dangers and difficulties,
that invaded me as in the state of dreaming; and I had no
thought about my bathing or eating or worshipping my Maker (the
mind being wholly occupied by the objects of the dream).</p>

<p class='c009'>30. I passed the night in restlessness and disquiet, shaking
like the branch of a tree; and this single night of trouble was
as long as it was tedious to me (like the time of a lingering
disease).</p>

<p class='c009'>31. A melancholy overspread my countenance, as darkness
had veiled the face of the night, and my waking eyes kept
watching for the day, like blue-lotuses expecting with
their watchful eyes the rising moon.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. The demoniac noise of wild beasts being hushed in the
forest at the end of the night, there fell a shivering fit
on me with the clattering of my teeth through excessive cold.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. I then beheld the east, red with the flush of intoxication;
as if it was laughing at seeing me drowned in my difficulties.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. I saw the sun advancing afterwards towards the earth, and
to mount on his Airávata the regent elephant of that quarter.
He seemed to be so full of glee, as the ignorant man has in
his folly, and the poor man in obtaining a treasure.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>35. Having got up from my mossy bed, I shook off my bed
cloth, like the god Siva tossing about his elephantine
hide at his giddy dance in the evening. (See Magh. Book I).</p>

<p class='c009'>36. I then began to wander in the wide forestland, as the
god Rudra roves about the wide world, after its desolation
by his demons at the end of kalpas.</p>

<p class='c009'>37. There was no animal of any kind to be seen in the desolate
desert, as the good qualities of good breeding, are never to
be found in the persons of the illiterate.</p>

<p class='c009'>38. I saw only the lively birds, perching and chirping
all about the woods without intermission.</p>

<p class='c009'>39. It was then at mid-day, when the sun had run his eighth hour,
and the plants had dried up the dews of their morning baths.</p>

<p class='c009'>40. That I beheld a damsel carrying some food and a goblet of
water, on the way as Hari bore the poisonous liquor to the
demons in his disguise in the shape of Mádhaví.</p>

<p class='c009'>41. She was of a swarthy complexion, and dressed in sable
black attire; and looked askance at me; when I advanced
towards her as the bright moon appears towards the dark
and sable night.</p>

<p class='c009'>42. I asked her to give me some of her food in my great
distress, because, I told her, one is enriched by relieving
the distress of the needy.</p>

<p class='c009'>43. O good maid; said I, increasing hunger is consuming my
bowels and I would take any food, even as the female serpent
devours her own brood and young, in the excess of her hunger.
(Hunger beats down the stony wall, and impure food is pure
to the hungry).</p>

<p class='c009'>44. I begged of thee and yet thou gavest me nothing, but
dost remain as inexorable as the goddess of fortune, who
declines to favour the wretched, however they implore her
aid. (Fortune turns a deaf ear to the supplications of
the poor).</p>

<p class='c009'>45. Then I kept a long time, following her closely from
one wood to another, and clinging to her as her shadow,
moving behind her in the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>46. She then turned to me and said:—Know me, to be a Chandála
girl and bearing the name of Harakeyuri; we are as cruel as
Rákshasas, and feeders on human flesh as on those of horses
and elephants.</p>

<p class='c009'>47. You cannot, O King! get your food by merely your craving
it of me; as it is hard to have the favour of men, without
first meeting with their desires.</p>

<p class='c009'>48. Saying so, she went on trippingly at every step, and
then entered into an arbour on the wayside and spoke merrily
unto me saying:—</p>

<p class='c009'>49. Well, I will give you of this food, if you will consent
to be my husband; for it is not the business of base and
common people to do good to others, before securing their
own good.</p>

<p class='c009'>50. My Chandála father is here ploughing in the field, with
his sturdy yoke of bulls, and has the figure of a demon,
standing in the cemetery with his haggardly hungry and
dusky stature.</p>

<p class='c009'>51. This food is for him, and may be given to you, if you
will agree to espouse me; because the husband deserves to
be served even at the peril of one’s life.</p>

<p class='c009'>52. To this I replied, I agree to take thee to my wife, for
what fool is there that will abide by the usage of his family,
when his life is in danger?</p>

<p class='c009'>53. She then gave me half of the food she had with her,
as Mádhaví parted with half of her ambrosia to the hungry
Indra of old.</p>

<p class='c009'>54. I ate the Chandál’s food, and drank the beverage of
<i>Jambu</i> fruits which she gave me; and then rested at that
place, and fell to a sleep caused by my fatigue and long
walking.</p>

<p class='c009'>55. Then she approached to me, as a black cloud advances
before the sun; she held me in her arms, and led me onward
with her guiding hand, and as fondly as her second self.</p>

<p class='c009'>56. She took me to her father, a fat and ugly fellow of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>repulsive appearance; as the tormenting agony of death,
leads a person to the hideous cell of the devil.</p>

<p class='c009'>57. My companion whispered to his ears the tidings of our
case, as the black bee hums her tale softly to the ear of
an elephant (in order to sip his frontal juice or ichor of
<i>mada-bárí</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>58. This man, said she, is to be my husband, if you, my father,
will give your consent. To this he expressed his approval
by saying—“Vádham be it so” by the end of this day (when
marriage rites usually take place and is called godhuli, or
the dusty dusk of returning herds from their pasture grounds).</p>

<p class='c009'>59. He loosened the bulls from their yoke, as the regent of
death releases his hell hounds. And it was in the dusk of the
day, when the sky was obscured by the evening mist, and rising
dust of <i>godhuli</i>, that we were dismissed from the demons’
presence, to take our own way.</p>

<p class='c009'>60. We passed the great jungle in a short time, and reached
the Chandála’s abode in the evening; as the demons pass amidst
the funeral ground, to rest in their charnel vaults at night.</p>

<p class='c009'>61. The dwelling had on one side, the slaughtered monkeys,
cocks and crows; and swarms of flies flying over them, and
sucking the blood sprinkled over the ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>62. The moist entrails and arteries of the slaughtered
beasts, that were hung up to be dried in the sun; were chased
by the ravenous birds of the air, that kept hovering over them;
while flocks of birds fluttered over the <i>Jambira</i> trees (to pick
up the fruits for their food).</p>

<p class='c009'>63. There were heaps of fat laid up to be dried in the portico,
and ravenous birds flying over them; and the skins of the slain
animals, which were besmeared with blood, lay in piles before
their sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>64. Little children had bits of flesh in their hands, beset by
buzzing flies; and there were the veteran Chandálas, sitting
by and rebuking the boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>65. We then entered the house scattered with disgusting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>entrails and intestines about, and I thought myself as the
ghost of a dead man standing beside the regent of death.</p>

<p class='c009'>66. I had then a seat of a big plantain leaf, given to me
with due respect, in order to be seated as a welcome guest,
in the abominable abode of my new-earned father-in-law.</p>

<p class='c009'>67. My squint eyed mother-in-law then eyed at me, with her
blood-red eyeballs; and muttered with gladness in her look,
“is this our would-be son-in-law?”</p>

<p class='c009'>68. Afterwards we sat on some seats of skin, and I partook
of the repast which was served before me, as the reward of my
sins. (<i>i.e.</i> This fare was as unpalatable, as the requital of
one’s crimes).</p>

<p class='c009'>69. I heard there many of those endearing words, which were
the seeds of endless misery; as also many such speeches that
were unpleasant to my mind, for their being of no benefit to
me.</p>

<p class='c009'>70. Afterwards, it came to pass on one day, when the sky was
cloudless and the stars were shining; that they presented a
dowry of cloths and other articles before me (as dánadravya).</p>

<p class='c009'>71. With these they made over that frightful maiden to me, and
we were joined together as black and white, and as sin and its
torment together (<i>i.e.</i> she was given to torment me for
my past sins).</p>

<p class='c009'>72. The flesh-eating Chandálas, festivated the marriage ceremony
with profusion of wine and loud shouts of joy; they beat their
sounding tomtoms with merriment, as wicked men delight in carrying
on the acts of their vileness. (The giddy mirth of the rabble, is
compared with the revelry of the riotous).</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. The King’s residence at the Chandála’s abode
and his adventures during sixty years at that place.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> king continued:—What more shall I say of that festivity,
which had quite subdued my soul? I was thenceforward named as
Pushta-Pukkusha or cherished Chandála by my fellows.
(Beng-ghar-jámái or home-bred bridegroom).
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. After the festivity had lasted for a week, and I had passed
full eight months at that place; my wife had her pubertal
efflorescence, and afterwards her conception also (garbhádhána
and garbha).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. She was delivered of a daughter which is the cause of
woe, as a danger is the spring of calamities. (The parallel
passage is well known <i>dáriká dukhkha dáyika</i>, a daughter
is the source of grief). This daughter grew up as soon as
the growth of the cares and sorrows of the ignorant. (The
wise neither care nor sorrow for any earthly matter).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. She brought forth again a black boy in course of three years;
as the fruit of folly raises the false expectation of fruition.
(<i>i.e.</i> We are often frustrated in our hopes in our boys).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. She again gave birth to a daughter and then to another
boy; and thus I became an old Chandála, with a large family
in that forest land.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. In this manner passed many years with these shoots of my
woe in that place; as a Brahmicide has to pass long years of
torment in hell-fire. (Here is a piece of priestcraft in the
augmented torment for killing a Brahman as any other man).</p>

<p class='c009'>7. I had to undergo all the pains of heat and cold, of chill-winds
and frost, without any help to be had in that dreary forest; and
as an old tortoise is constrained to move about in the mud of a
pool for ever.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>8. Being burthen with the cares of my family, and troubled
by anxieties of my mind; I saw my increasing afflictions
like a conflagration rising all about me.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. Clad in bark and wrapt in old and ragged cloths, with a
covering of grass and a straw hat on my head, I bore loads
of logs from the woods; as we bear the burden of sins on our
backs and heads. (See Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress).</p>

<p class='c009'>10. I had to pass full many a live-long year, under the shade
of <i>dhavalí</i> trees; with no other cloth or covering on me
than an old tattered, dirty and stinking <i>Kaupina</i>, which was
beset by fleas and leeches. (Kaupina a piece of rag covering the
lower secret parts of the body as that of Fakirs and Yogis).</p>

<p class='c009'>11. I was exposed to the chill cold winds, in all my toils
to support my family; and lay like a frog in some cave in
the woods, under the keen blasts of winter.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. The many quarrels and bickerings, and the sorrows and
wailings, to which I was often exposed at home and abroad,
made my blood to gush out in tears from my weeping eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. We passed the nights on marshy grounds in the jungle, and
being deluged by the raining clouds, we took our shelter in
the caverns of mountains, with no other food than the roasted
flesh of bears.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. Afterwards the rainy season of sowing being over, and
the dark drizzling clouds having dispersed in air, I was
driven from my abode, by the unkindness of my relations
and continued contention with others.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. Being thus in dread of every body in the neighbourhood,
I removed myself to the house of another man, where I dwelt
with my wife and prattling children for some years.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. Then vexed by the scolding of the termagant Chandálí, and
the threats of the villainous Chandálas; my face became as pale
as the waning moon under the shadow of Ráhu (the ascending node).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. I was bit and scratched by the teeth and nails of my wife,
as if my flesh and muscles were torn and gnawed down under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>grinders of a tigress; and I was as one caught by or sold to
a hellish fiend, and thought myself as changed to an infernal
being also.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. I suffered under the torrents of snow thrown out of the
caverns of the Himálaya, and was exposed to the showers of
frost, that fell continually in the dewy season.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. I felt on my naked body the iron shafts of rain, as darts
let fly from the bow of death; and in my sickly and decrepit
old age, I had to live upon the roots of withered vegetables.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. I dug them out plentifully from the woodland grounds and
eat them with a zest, as a fortunate man has in tasting his
dainty dishes of well cooked meat.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. I took my food apart and untouched by any body, for fear
of being polluted by the touch of a vile and base born family;
and because the pungency of my unsavoury diet, made my mouth
wry at every morsel.</p>

<p class='c009'>22. While I was famishing in this manner, I saw others had
their venison and sheep’s flesh bought from other places for
their food; and who pampered their bodies also with the flesh
they cut out from other living animals and devoured raw with
great zest.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. They bought animal flesh sold in iron pots and stuck in
spits, for undergoing migrations into as many thousand bodies
as they have killed and fed upon. (This is the Pythagorean
doctrine of metempsychosis of the soul, as described in
Goldsmith’s Citizen of the World).</p>

<p class='c009'>24. I often repaired to the garden grounds of the Chandálas,
with my spade and basket in the cool of the evening, in order
to collect the raw flesh, which had been cast about in the dirt,
for making any food of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. But the time seemed to turn favourable to me, when I was
about to be cast into hell, by leading me to take refuge of the
mountain caverns, and seek my supportance there by the roots
and plants growing therein.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. In this state, I was met by my good chance, on some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>Chandálas appearing in person before me, and driving away the
village dogs with their clubs from before them (to the woods).</p>

<p class='c009'>27. They gave my wife and children some bad rice as the
villagers used to take, and we passed the night under the
shade of a palm tree, whose withered leaves were rattling
with the rain drops, that fell in showers upon them.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. We passed the night in company with the sylvan apes, with
our teeth clattering with cold; and the hairs of our bodies
standing on their ends, like a thousand thorns through coldness.</p>

<p class='c009'>29. The rain drops decorated our bodies with granules of
vivid pearls, and our bellies were as lean and lank like
an empty cloud through hunger and for want of food.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. Then there rose a quarrel in this diresome forest, between
me and my wife; and we kept answering one another, with our
clattering teeth and ruddy eyes by effect of the cold.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. My foul and dirty person resembled that of a dark black
demon, and we roved about the borders of rivers and brooks,
to fish with a rod and hook in my hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. I wandered also with a trap in my hand, like Yama with his
noose at the desolation of the earth; and caught and killed
and drank the heart blood of the deer in my hunger and thirst.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. I sucked the warm heart blood, as the milk of my mother’s
breast, at the time of famishing; and being besmeared in blood,
I stood as a blood sucking demon in the cemetery.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. The Vetálas of the woods fled before me, as they do from
the furies of the forests; and I set my snares and nets in
the woods, for catching the deer and birds of the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>35. As people spread the nets of their wives and children, only
to be entangled in them in the false hope of happiness; so
did I spread my net of thread, to beguile the birds to their
destruction.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. Though worried and worn out in the nets of worldly cares, and
surrounded on every side by the miseries of our vicious lives; yet
do our minds take their delight, in the perpetration of cruel and
foul acts (to the injury of others).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>37. Our wishes are stretched as far and wide, as a running
river overflows its banks in the rainy season; but the objects
of our desires fly afar from us, as snakes hide themselves from
the snake eating <i>Karabhas</i> by their own sagacity. (The Karabha
is a quadruped of the weasel kind, and is called <i>gohadgel</i>—in
Bengali).</p>

<p class='c009'>38. We have cast off kindness from our hearts, as the snake
leaves off his slough; and take a delight to let fly the hissing
arrows of our malice, as the thunder storm betides all animals.</p>

<p class='c009'>39. Men are delighted at the sight of cooling clouds, at the
end of the hot season; but they avoid at a distance the rough
briny shore spreading wide before them. (So men hail their
happiness, and avoid their troubles).</p>

<p class='c009'>40. But I underwent many a difficulty, which multiplied as
thickly upon me, as the weeds growing in dales; and I moved
about all the corners of that hellish spot, during my destined
time. (What is decreed, cannot be avoided).</p>

<p class='c009'>41. I have sown the seeds of sin under the rain-water of my
ignorance, to grow speedily as thorns on my way. I have laid
hidden snares for the unwary innocent, to secure myself in
the mountain caves.</p>

<p class='c009'>42. I have caught and killed the innocent deer in the trap;
to feed upon its flesh; and have killed the <i>chouri</i> kine,
to lay my head on the hair hanging down their necks.</p>

<p class='c009'>43. I slept unconscious of myself in my ignorance, as Vishnu
lay on his huge hydra; I lay with my out-stretched legs and
limbs in the brown cell, resounding to the yell of wild beasts
abroad.</p>

<p class='c009'>44. I lay my body also, on the frost of a cave in the marshy
ground of Vindhyá; and wrapped my swarthy form in a tattered
quilt, hanging down my neck and full of fleas.</p>

<p class='c009'>45. I bore it on my back, as a bear bears the long bristles upon
him even in the hot season; and suffered the heat of the wild fire,
which burnt away many wild animals which perished in groups
as in the last conflagration of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>46. My wife bore her young ones, both for our pleasure as well
as pain: as the food of the glutton, is both for his satiety
and sickness; and the influence of planets, is for our good
and evil also.</p>

<p class='c009'>47. Thus I the only son of a king, had to pass sixty painful
years of my life, as so many kalpa ages of long duration.</p>

<p class='c009'>48. I raved sometimes in my rage, and wept at others in my
bitter grief; I fared on coarse meals, and dwelt, alas! in
the abodes of vulgar Chandálas. Thus I passed so many years of
my misery at that place, as one fastened to the fetters of his
insatiable desires, is doomed to toil and moil for naught until
his death. (Bound to our desires, we are dragged to the grave).</p>

Argument. The distress of Chandálas caused by famine and want of Rain.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> king continued to say:—Time passed away, and old age
overtook me, and turned my beard to blades of grass covered
with hoar frost.
 </p>

<p class='c009'>2. My days glided away in alternate joy and grief, brought
on by my fate and acts; just as a river flows on with the
green and dried leaves, which the winds scatter over it.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Quarrels and broils, misfortunes and mischances, befell
on me every moment; and beset me as thickly and as fastly
as the arrows of woe flying in a warfare.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. My foolish mind kept fluttering like a bird, in the maze
of my wishes and fancies; and my heart was perturbed by
passions, like the sea by its raging waves.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. My soul was revolving on the vehicle of my wandering
thoughts; and I was borne away by them like a floating
straw, to the whirlpool of the eventful ocean of time.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. I that moved about like a worm amidst the woodlands
of Vindhyá, for my simple supportance, felt myself in
the process of years, to be weakened and pulled down
in my frame, like a biped beast of burthen.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. I forgot my royalty like a dead man, in that state of my
wretchedness, and was confirmed in my belief of a Chandála,
and bound to that hilly spot like a wingless bird.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. The world appeared to me, as desolate as at its final
desolation; and as a forest consumed by a conflagration;
it seemed as the sea-shore lashed by huge surges; and as
a withered tree struck by a lightning.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. The marshy ground at the foot of Vindhyá was all dried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>up, and left no corn nor vegetable, nor any water for food or
drink; and the whole group of Chandálas, was about to die in
dearth and dryness.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. The clouds ceased to rain, and disappeared from sight;
and the winds blew with sparks of fire in them. (The hot
winds of the monsoon called agni-vrishti).</p>

<p class='c009'>11. The forest trees were bare and leafless, and the withered
leaves were strewn over the ground; wild fires were raging here
and there, and the wood-lands became as desolate, as the abodes
of austere ascetics (dwelling in the deserts).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. There ensued a formidable famine, and a furious flame
of wildfire spread all around; it burnt down the whole forest,
and reduced the grass and gravels all to ashes.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. The people were daubed with ashes all over their bodies,
and were famishing for want of food and drink; because the
land was without any article of food or even grass or water
in it, and had turned to a dreary desert.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. The mirage of the desert glistened as water, and deluded
the dry buffaloes to roll in it (as in a pool); and there was
no current of breeze to cool the desert air.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. The call and cry for water, came only to the ears of men;
who were parching under the burning rays of the torrid sun
(in the Deccan).</p>

<p class='c009'>16. The hungry mob, hurrying to browse the branches and herbs,
yielded their lives in those acts; while others sharpened their
teeth, in their acts of tearing and devouring one another.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. Some ran to bite the gum of catechu, thinking it to
be a bit of flesh; while others were swallowing the stones,
as if they were cakes lying on the ground before them.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. The ground was sprinkled with blood, by the mutual biting
and tearing of men; as when blood is spilt in profusion,
by the lion’s killing a big and starving elephant.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. Every one was as ferocious as a lion, in his attempt to
devour another as his prey; and men mutually fought with one
another, as wrestlers do in their contest.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>20. The trees were leafless, and the hot winds were blowing
as fire-brands on all sides; and wild cats were licking the
human blood, that was spilt on the rocky ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. The flame of the wild fire rose high in the air, with
clouds of smoke whirling with the howling winds of the forest;
it growled aloud in every place, and filled the forest-land with
heaps of brown cinders and burning fire brands.</p>

<p class='c009'>22. Huge serpents were burnt in their caves, and the fumes
rising from these burning bodies, served to grow the poisonous
plants on the spot; while the flame stretching aloft with the
winds, gave the sky an appearance of the glory of the setting
sun.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. Heaps of ashes were lifted like dust, by the high howling
winds, and stood as domes unsupported by pillars in the open
sky; and the little children stood crying for fear of them,
beside their weeping parents.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. There were some men who tore a dead body with their teeth,
and in their great haste to devour the flesh, bit their own
hands and fingers, which were besmeared in their own blood.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. The vultures flying in the air, darted upon the smoke,
thinking it a turret of trees, and pounced upon the fire
brands, taking them for bits of raw flesh.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. Men biting and tearing one another, were flying in all
directions; when the splitting of the burning wood hit upon
their breasts and bellies, and made them gory with blood
gushing out of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. The winds were howling in the hollow caves, and the flames
of the wild fire flashing with fury; the snakes were hissing
for fear of these, and the burnt woods were falling down with
hideous noise.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. Thus beset by dangers and horrors, with no other shelter
than the rugged hollows of rocks, this place presented a picture
of this world, with its circumambient flames, burning as the
twelve zodiacal suns on high.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>29. The winds were blowing hot amidst the burning woods and
rocks, and drying up all things; and the heat of the fire
below and the sunbeams above, together with the domestic
calamities caused by influence of the planet Saturn, made
this place a counterpart of this woeful world.</p>

of the last dissolution prematurely overtook the forest and
mountaineers here:—
 </p>

<p class='c009'>2. Some of these men went out from that place, with their
wives and children, in search of some new abodes in foreign
lands; as the clouds disperse and disappear from the sky,
after the rainy season is over.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. They were accompanied by their wives and children and
close relatives, who clung to them as the members of their
bodies; but the lean and infirm were left behind them, like
the separated branches of trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Some of these emigrants were devoured by tigers, as they
went out of their houses; as unfledged birds are caught by
falcons, as they come out of their nests.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Some entered into the fire like moths, to put an end to
their miserable lives; others fell into the pits, like
fragments of rocks falling from the hills.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. I separated myself from the connections of my father-in-law
and others; and depending upon myself, I escaped narrowly from
that distressed country, with my wife and children about me.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. We passed the pit-falls and storms, and the wild beasts
and snakes, without any harm; and came out of that forest
safe from all the deadly perils of the way.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Having then arrived at the border of that forest, we got
to the shade of some palm trees, where I lay down my children
from my shoulders as burdens of my sin and woes.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c010'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>9. I halted here after my tiresome journey and lengthened
troubles, as one who had fled from the confines of hell;
and took my rest like the withering lotus, from the
scorching sun-beams and heat of summer.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. My Chandála wife also slept under the same tree, and
my two boys lay fast asleep in each other’s embrace, under
the cooling shade.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. Afterwards my younger son Prach’chhaka, who was as
dear to us as he was the less intelligent, rose up and
stood before me.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. He said with a depressed spirit, and tears gushing out
of his eyes, “Papa give me soon some meat-food and drink or
else I die”.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. The little boy repeatedly made the same request, and
said with tears in his eyes, that he was dying of hunger.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. I told him I had no meat, and the more I said so, the
more he repeated his foolish craving, which could neither
be supplied with nor put down to silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. I was then moved by paternal affection, and affliction
of my heart, to tell him, “child, cut off a slice of my
flesh, and roast and eat it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>16. He agreed to it, and said ‘give it then’; because his hunger
was so pressing and his vitality was so much exhausted, that
he could not decline to crave my flesh for his food.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. Being then overpowered by affection and compassion I
thought of putting an end to all my grief with my life, which
became so intolerable to me at his excessive distress.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. Being unable to endure the pain of my affection, I
despaired of my own life; and resolved to resort to death,
as my only friend at this last extremity.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. I collected some wood, and heaped them together for my
funeral pile, and having put it on fire, I saw it blaze as
I wished.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. As I was hastening to throw myself on this pile, I was
immediately roused from my reverie by the sound of music
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>proceeding from this palace, hailing me as king, and shouting
my victory <i>jaya</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. I understood this conjurer had wrought this enchantment
on me, and put me to all these imaginable troubles for so
long a period.</p>

<p class='c009'>22. Like the ignorant, I was subject to a hundred changes
of fortune (which can never approach the wise). As the
great and mighty King—Lavana, had been recapitulating and
expostulating on the vicissitudes of fortune:—</p>

<p class='c009'>23. The sorcerer suddenly disappeared from his sight, at
which the courtiers looked around them with their staring
eyes; and then addressed the king, saying:—</p>

<p class='c009'>24. This man was no sorcerer, our liege lord! who had no
mercenary views of his own in this; but it was a divine
magic (theurgy), that was displayed to our lord, to
represent the lot of humanity and the state of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. This world is evidently a creation of the mind, and the
imaginary world is only a display of the infinite power of
the Almighty. (It was a coinage of the brain, a stretch of
the imagination which gives images to ideals).</p>

<p class='c009'>26. These hundreds of worldly systems, display the multifarious
powers of Omnipotence; which delude even the minds of the most
wise, to believe in the reality of unrealities, as it were
by the spell of magic.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. This delusion being so potent on the minds of wise, it
is no wonder, that our king would be overpowered by it, when
all common minds are labouring under the same error.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. This delusive magic was not spread over the mind, by
any trick or art of the conjurer; who aimed at nothing more
than his own gain, by the act of his sorcery. (It is the divine
will, which spreads the illusion alike on all minds).</p>

<p class='c009'>29. They that love money, never go away of themselves
without getting something: therefore we are tossed on the
waves of doubt (<i>i.e.</i> doubtful) to take him for a sorcerer.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. Vasishtha said:—Ráma! though I am sitting here at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>this moment, before you and others of this assembly; yet I am
quite sensible of the truth of this story, which is no fiction like
the tale of the boy I have told you before, nor is it any coining
or hearsay of mine.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. Thus the mind is enlarged by the various inventions of
its imagination, as a tree is extended by the expansion of
its boughs and branches. The extended mind encompasses all
things, as an outstretched arbor overspreads on the ground. It
is the mind’s comprehension of every thing, and its conversancy
with the natures of all things, that serve to lead it to its state
of perfection. (The amplitude of the mind, consists in the extent
of its knowledge).</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. The great Magnitude of mental
powers, and government of the Mind.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> said:—Since the subjective Intellect <i>chit</i>, has
derived the power of knowing the objective Intelligibles
<i>chetyas</i>, from the supreme cause in the beginning; it went on
to multiply and diversify the objects of its intelligence, and
thus fell from the knowledge of the one intelligent Universal
<i>Ego</i>, to the delusion of the particular <i>non egos ad infinitum</i>.
(The knowledge of the subjective universal soul being lost, the
mind is left to be bewildered in the objective particulars to no
end).
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Thus Ráma, the faculties of the mind, being deluded by
the unrealities of particulars, they continue to attribute
specialities and differences to the general ones to their
utter error. (Multiplication and differentiation of objects,
mislead the mind from the universal unity of the only one).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. The mental powers are ever busy to multiply the unrealities
to infinity, as ignorant children are prone to create the false
goblins of their fancy, only for their terror and trouble.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. But the reality soon disperses the troublesome unrealities,
and the unsullied understanding drives off the errors of imagination,
as the sun-shine dispels the darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. The mind brings distant objects near it, and throws the
nearer ones at a distance; it trots and flutters in living
beings, as boys leap and jump in bushes after little birds.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. The wistful mind is fearful, where there is nothing to
fear; as the affrighted traveller takes the stump of a tree
for demon, standing on his way.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. The suspicious mind suspects a friend for a foe, as a
drunken sot thinks himself lying on the ground, while he
is walking along.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>8. The distracted mind, sees the fiery Saturn in the cooling
moon; and the nectar being swallowed as poison, acts as poison
itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. The building of an aerial castle however untrue, is taken
for truth for the time being; and the mind dwelling on hopes,
is a dreamer in its waking state.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. The disease of desire is the delusion of the mind; therefore
it is to be rooted out at once with all diligence from the mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. The minds of men being entangled in the net of avarice like
poor stags, are rendered as helpless as these beasts of prey,
in the forest of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. He who has removed by his reasoning, the vain anxieties
of his mind, has displayed the light of his soul, like that
of the unclouded sun to sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. Know therefore that it is mind that make the man and
not his body that is called as such: the body is dull matter,
but the mind is neither a material nor immaterial substance
(as the spirit).</p>

<p class='c009'>14. Whatever is done with the mind or voluntarily by any
man, know Ráma, that act to be actually done by him (since an
involuntary action is indifferent by itself); and whatsoever
is shunned by it, know that to be kept out <i>in actu</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. The mind alone makes the whole world, to the utmost end
of the spheres; the mind is the vacuum, and it is the air and
earth in its greatness. (Since it comprehends them all in itself;
and none of these is perceptible without the mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>16. If the mind do not join a thing with its known properties
and qualities; then the sun and the luminaries would appear
to be without their light (as it is with the day-blind bats and
owls, that take the day light for darkness, and the dark night
for their bright day light).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. The mind assumes the properties of knowledge and
ignorance, whence it is called a knowing or unknowing
thing; but these properties are not to be attributed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>the body, for a living body is never known to be wise,
nor a dead carcase an ignorant person.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. The mind becomes the sight in its act of seeing, and it
is hearing also when it hears any thing; it is the feeling of
touch in connection with the skin, and it is smelling when
connected with the nose.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. So it becomes taste being connected with the tongue and
palate, and takes many other names besides, according to its
other faculties. Thus the mind is the chief actor on the
stage of the living animal body.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. It magnifies the minute and makes the true appear as
untrue; it sweetens the bitter and sours the sweet, and
turns a foe to a friend and <i>vice-versa</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. In whatever manner the mind represents itself in its
various aspects, the same becomes evident to us both in our
perceptions and conceptions of them. (<i>i.e.</i> Every body takes
things in the same light, as his mind represents them unto him).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. It was by virtue of such a representation, that the dreaming
mind of king Haris chandra, took the course of one night for the
long period of a dozen of years.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. It was owing to a similar idea of the mind, that the
whole city of Brahmá appeared to be situated within himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. The presentation of a fair prospect before the imagination,
turns the present pain to pleasure; as a man bound in chains
forgets his painful state, in the hopes of his release or
installation on the next morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. The mind being well fortified and brought under the
subjection of reason, brings all the members of the body and
internal passions of the heart under our control; but the loose
and ungoverned mind, gives a loose rein to them for their going
astray; as the loosened thread of a string of pearls, scatters
the precious grains at random over the ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. The mind that preserves its clear sightedness, and its
equanimity and unalterableness in all places, and under all
conditions; retains its even temper and nice discernment at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>all times, under the testimony of its consciousness, and
approbation of its good conscience.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. With your mind acquainted with the states of all things, but
undisturbed by the fluctuations of the objects that come under
your cognizance, you must retain, O Ráma! your self-possession
at all times, and remain like a dumb and dull body, (without
being moved by any thing).</p>

<p class='c009'>28. The mind is restless of its own nature, with all its vain
thoughts and desires within itself; but the man is carried
abroad as by its current; over hills and deserts and across
rivers and seas, to far and remote cities and countries (in
search of gain).</p>

<p class='c009'>29. The waking mind deems the objects of its desire, to be as
sweet as honey, and whatever it does not like, to be as bitter
as gall; although they may be sweet to taste; (<i>i.e.</i> the blindness
of sensuous minds in their choice of evil for good, and
slighting of good as evil).</p>

<p class='c009'>30. Some minds with too much self reliance  in themselves,
and without considering the true nature of things; give them
different forms and colours, according to their own conceptions
and opinions, though they are far from truth. (Every man
delights in his own hobby horse).</p>

<p class='c009'>31. The mind is a pulsation of the power of the Divine Intellect,
that ventilates in the breeze and glares in luminous bodies,
melts in the liquids and hardens in solid substances. (Compare
the lines of Pope: “Glows in the sun &amp;c.” The mind is dependent
on the intellect, and the mental operations, are subordinate to
the intellectual).</p>

<p class='c009'>32. It vanishes in vacuity and extends in the space; it
dwells in everything at its pleasure, and flies from
everywhere at its will.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. It whitens the black and blackens the white, and is
confined to no place or time but extends through all.
(The mind can make a heaven of hell, and a hell of heaven).</p>

<p class='c009'>34. The mind being absent or settled elsewhere, we do not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>taste the sweet, which we suck or swallow or grind under
the teeth or lick with the tongue.</p>

<p class='c009'>35. What is seen by the mind, is seen with the eyes, and
what is unseen by it, is never seen by the visual organs; as
things lying in the dark are not perceptible to the sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. The mind is embodied in the organic body, accompanied by the
sensible organs; but it is the mind that actuates the senses
and receives the sensations; the senses are the products of the
mind, but the mind is not a production of sensations.</p>

<p class='c009'>37. Those great souls (philosophers), who have investigated
into the manner of the connection between the two quite different
substances of the body and mind, and those learned men who show
us their mutual relations (the psychologists), are truly worthy
of our veneration.</p>

<p class='c009'>38. A handsome woman decked with flowers in the braids of her
hair, and looking loosely with her amorous glances, is like
a log of wood, in contact with the body of one, whose mind is
absent from himself. (The dalliance of a woman is dead and lost,
to the unfeeling heart and unmindful man).</p>

<p class='c009'>39. The dispassionate <i>Yogi</i> that sits reclined in his abstract
meditation in the forest, has no sense of his hands being bitten
off by a voracious beast from his body; owing to the absence of
his mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>40. The mind of the sage, which is practised in mental abstraction,
may with ease be inclined to convert his pleasures to pain, and his
pains to pleasure.</p>

<p class='c009'>41. The mind employed in some other thought and inattentive
to the present discourse, finds it as a detached piece of
wood dissevered by an axe. (The presence of the mind joins
the parts of a lecture, as its inadvertence disjoins them from
their consecutive order).</p>

<p class='c009'>42. A man sitting at home, and thinking of his standing on
the precipice of a mountain, or falling into the hollow cave
below, shudders at the idea of his imminent danger: so also one
is startled at the prospect of a dreary desert even in his dream,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>and is bewildered to imagine the vast deep under the clouds.
(See Hume on the Association of Ideas).</p>

<p class='c009'>43. The mind feels a delight at the sight of a lovely spot in
its dream, and at seeing the hills, cities and houses stretching
on, the clusters of stars shining in the extended plain of the
sky. (Objects which are pleasurable or painful to the sight,
give pleasure and pain to the mind, when it is connected with
that sense).</p>

<p class='c009'>44. The restless mind is busy to stretch many a hill and
dale and cities and houses in our dreams, as these are the
billows in the vast ocean of the soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>45. As the waters of the sea display themselves in huge surges,
billows and waves, so the mind which is in the body, displays
itself in the various sights exhibited in our dreams.
(Meaning, the dreams to be transformations (<i>Vikáras</i>) of the
mind, like the waves of the water).</p>

<p class='c009'>46. As the leaves and branches, flowers and fruits are the
products of the shooting seed; so every thing that is seen
in our waking dreams, is the creations of our minds.</p>

<p class='c009'>47. As a golden image is no other than the very gold, so
the creatures of our living dreams, are not otherwise than
the creations of our fanciful mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>48. As a drop or shower of rain, and a foam or froth of the
wave, are but different forms of water; so the varieties
(<i>manatá</i>), of sensible objects are but formations of the
same mind. (Lit. formations or transformations of the mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>49. These are but the thoughts of our minds, that are seen
in our waking dreams; like the various garbs which an actor
puts on him, to represent different characters in a play.</p>

<p class='c009'>50. As the king Lavana believed himself to be a chandála
for some time, so do we believe ourselves to be so and so,
by the thoughts of our minds.</p>

<p class='c009'>51. Whatever we think ourselves to be in our consciousness,
the same soon comes to pass upon us; therefore mould the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>thoughts of your mind in any way you like. (<i>i.e.</i> As one
thinks himself to be, so will he find himself to become
in his own conceit).</p>

<p class='c009'>52. The embodied being beholds many cities and towns, hills
and rivers before him; all which are but visions of waking
dreams, and stretched out by the inward mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>53. One sees a demon in a deity, and a snake where there
is no snake; it is the idea that fosters the thought, as
the king Lavana fostered the thoughts of his ideal forms.</p>

<p class='c009'>54. As the idea of man includes that of a woman also, and the idea
of father comprises that of the son likewise; so the mind includes
the wish, and the wish is accompanied by its action with every
person. (As when I say I have a mind to do so, I mean I have a
wish to do it; and the same wish leads me to its execution. Or
that the action is concomitant with the will so the phrase:
“take will for the deed”).</p>

<p class='c009'>55. It is by its wish that the mind is subject to death, and
to be born again in other bodies; and though it is a formless
thing of its nature, yet it is by its constant habit of thinking,
that it contracts the notion of its being a living substance
(jíva).</p>

<p class='c009'>56. The mind is busy with its thoughts of long drawn wishes,
which cause its repeated births and deaths, and their
concomitants of hopes and fears, and pleasure and pain.
(The wish is father of thoughts, and these mould our acts
and lives).</p>

<p class='c009'>57. Pleasure and pain are situated in the mind like the oil
in the sesamum seed, and these are thickened or thinned like
the oil under particular circumstances of life. Prosperity
thickens our pleasure, and adversity our pain; and these
are thinned by their reverses again.</p>

<p class='c009'>58. As it is the greater or lighter pressure of the oil-mill, that
thickens or thins the oil, so it is the deeper or lighter attention
of the mind, that aggravates or lightens its sense of pleasure
or pain. (Loss or gain unfelt, is nothing lost or gained.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>The pleasure or pain of which we are ignorant, is no pleasure
or pain).</p>

<p class='c009'>59. As our wishes are directed by the particular circumstances
of time and place, so the measurements of time and place, are
made according to the intensity or laxity of our thoughts. (<i>i.e.</i>
The intense application or inattention of the mind, prolongs
and shortens the measure of time and place to us).</p>

<p class='c009'>60. It is the mind that is satisfied and delighted at the fulfilment
of our wishes, and not the body which is insensible of its enjoyments.
(The commentary explains the participation of the enjoyment both by
the body and mind, and not by one independently of the other).</p>

<p class='c009'>61. The mind is delighted with its imaginary desires within the
body, as a secluded woman takes her delight in the seraglio.
(The pleasure of imagination pleases the inmost soul, when we
have no external and bodily pleasure to enjoy).</p>

<p class='c009'>62. He who does not give indulgence to levities and fickleness
in his heart, is sure to subdue his mind; as one binds an elephant
by its chain to the post.</p>

<p class='c009'>63. He whose mind does not wave to and fro like a brandished
sword, but remains fixed as a post or pillar to its best intent
and object, is the best of men on earth; all others (with fickle
minds), are as insects continually moving in the mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>64. He whose mind is freed from fickleness, and is sedate in
itself, is united with his best object in his meditation of
the same. (The unflinching mind, is sure of success).</p>

<p class='c009'>65. Steadiness of the mind is attended with the stillness of
worldly commotions, as the suspension of the churning Mandara,
was attended with the calmness of the ocean of milk.</p>

<p class='c009'>66. The thoughts of the mind being embroiled in worldly cares
(of gaining the objects of desire and enjoyments), become
the sources of those turbulent passions in the breast, which
like poisonous plants fill this baneful world (with their
deadly breath).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>67. Foolish men that are infatuated by their giddiness and
ignorance, revolve round the centre of their hearts, as the
giddy bees flutter about the lotus-flower of the lake; till
at last grown weary in their giddy circles, they fall down
in the encompassing whirlpools, which hurl them in
irreparable ruin.</p>

Arguments. Prompt relinquishment of desires, and abandonment

</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> continued:—Now attend to the best remedy, that I will
tell you to heal the disease of the heart; which is within one’s
own power and harmless, and a sweet potion to taste.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. It is by the exertion of your own consciousness by yourself,
and by diligent relinquishment of the best objects of your desire,
that you can bring back your refractory mind under your subjection.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. He who remains at rest by giving up the objects of his
desire, is verily the conqueror of his mind; which is reduced
under his subjection as an elephant wanting its tusks.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. The mind is to be carefully treated as a patient by the
prescriptions of reason, and by discriminating the truth from
untruth, as we do good diet from what is injurious.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Mould your heated imagination by cool reasoning, by precepts
of the Sástras, and by association with the dispassionate, as
they do the heated iron by a cold hammer.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. As a boy has no pain to turn himself this way and that in
his play; so it is not difficult to turn the mind, from one
thing to another at pleasure.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Employ your mind to the acts of goodness by the light of
your understanding; as you join your soul to the meditation
of God by light of your spirit.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. The renunciation of a highly desirable object, is in the
power of one, who resigns himself to the divine will; it is
a shame therefore to that worm of human being, who finds
this precept difficult for his practice.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>9. He who can take the unpleasant for the pleasurable in his
understanding; may with ease subdue his mind, as a giant overcomes
a boy by his might.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. It is possible to govern the mind like a horse, by one’s
attention and exertion; and the mind being brought to its
quietness, it is easy to enter into divine knowledge.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. Shame to that jackass (lit.: jackalish man), who has not
the power to subdue his restless mind, which is entirely under
his own subjection, and which he can easily govern.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. No one can reach the best course of his life, without the
tranquility of his mind; which is to be acquired by means of
his own exertion, in getting rid of the fond objects of his
desire. (The best course of life, is to live free from care,
which is unattainable without subjection of our desires).</p>

<p class='c009'>13. It is by means of destroying the appetites of the mind,
by means of reason and knowledge of truth; that one can have
his absolute dominion over it, without any change or rival in it.
(The rival powers in the kingdom of the mind (<i>manorájya</i>), are
the passions and the train of ignorance—<i>moha</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>14. The precepts of a preceptor, the instructions of the sástras,
the efficacy of mantras, and the force of arguments, are all as
trifles as straws, without that calmness of the mind, which can
be gained by renunciation of our desires and by the knowledge
of truth.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. The One All and all-pervading quiescent Brahma can be
known then only, when the desires of the mind are all cut
off by the weapon of indifference to all worldly things.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. All bodily pains of men are quite at an end, no sooner
the mind is at rest, after the removal of mental anxieties
by means of true knowledge.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. Many persons turn their minds to unmindfulness, by too
much trust in their exertions and imaginary expectations;
and disregarding the power of destiny, which overrules all
human efforts.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. The mind being long practised in its highest duty, of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>cultivation of divine knowledge, becomes extinct in the intellect,
and is elevated to its higher state of intellectual form.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. Join yourself to your intellectual or abstract thoughts at
first, and then to your spiritual speculations. Being then master
of your mind, contemplate on the nature of the Supreme soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. Thus relying on your own exertion, and converting the
sensible mind to its state of stoic insensibility, you can
attain to that highest state of fixedness, which knows no
decay nor destruction. (Spiritual bliss).</p>

<p class='c009'>21. It is by your exertion and fixed attention, O Ráma! that
you can correct the errors of your mind; as one gets over his
wrong apprehension of taking one thing for another (such as
his mistaking of the east for the west).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. Calmness of mind, produces the want of anxiety; and the
man that has been able to subdue his mind, cares a fig for
his subjection of the world under him. (For, what is this
world, without its perception in the mind?).</p>

<p class='c009'>23. Worldly possessions are attended with strife and warfare,
and the enjoyments of heaven also, have their rise and fall;
but in the improvement of one’s own mind and nature, there is
no contention with anybody, nor any obstruction of any kind.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. It is hard for them to manage their affairs well, who
cannot manage to keep their minds under proper control.
(Govern yourself ere you can govern others. Or:—Govern
your mind, lest it govern you).</p>

<p class='c009'>25. The thought of one’s being dead, and being born again as
a man, continually employ the minds of the ignorant with the
idea of their egoism (which is a false one, since the soul has
no birth or death, nor any personality of its own).</p>

<p class='c009'>26. So no body is born here nor dies at any time; it is the
mind that conceives its birth and death and migration in other
bodies and worlds. (<i>i.e.</i> Its transmigration and apprehension
of its rise or fall to heaven or hell).</p>

<p class='c009'>27. It goes hence to another world, and there appears in
another form (of the body and mind); or it is relieved from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>encumbrance of flesh, which is called its liberation. Where then
is this death and why fear to die (which is no more than progress
to a new life?).</p>

<p class='c009'>28. Whether the mind roves here; or goes to another world
with its earthly thoughts, it continues in the same state as
before unless it is changed to another form (of purity), by
its attainment of liberation (from humanity).</p>

<p class='c009'>29. It is in vain that we are overwhelmed in sorrow, upon the
demise of our brethren and dependants; since we know it is the
nature of the mind, to be thus deluded from its state of pure
intelligence to that of error. (It is the deluded mind, and not
the intelligent soul that is subject to sorrow).</p>

<p class='c009'>30. It has been repeatedly mentioned both before and afterwards,
and in many other places (of this work); that there is no
other means of obtaining the pure diet of true knowledge, without
subduing the mind (and bringing it under the control of reason).</p>

<p class='c009'>31. I repeat the same lesson, that there is no other way, save
by the government of the unruly mind, to come to the light of
the truly real, clear and catholic knowledge of the Supreme.
(By catholic knowledge is meant the universally received
doctrines of divinity).</p>

<p class='c009'>32. The mind being destroyed (<i>i.e.</i> all its function, being
suspended), the soul attains its tranquility, and the light
of the intellect shines forth in the cavity of the heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. Hold fast the discus of reason, and cut off the bias of
your mind; be sure that no disease will have the power to molest
you, if you can have the good sense to despise the objects of
pleasure, which are attended by pain. (All pleasure is followed
by pain. Or: Pleasure leads to pain, and pain succeeds pleasure).</p>

<p class='c009'>34. By lopping the members of the mind, you cut it off
altogether; and these being egoism and selfishness which
compose the essence of the mind. Shun your sense that
‘it is I’ and ‘these are mine.’</p>

<p class='c009'>35. Want of these feelings, casts down the mind like a tree
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>felled by the axe; and disperses it like a scattered cloud
from the autumnal sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. The mind is blown away by its destitution of egoism (<i>Ahantá</i>)
and meitatism (mamatá), like a cloud by the winds. (Unconsciousness
of one’s egoism and personality, is the tantamount to his utter
extinction, and unification with the one universal Soul).</p>

<p class='c009'>37. It is dangerous to wage a war, against winds and weapons,
and fire and water, in order to obtain the <a id="objects"></a>objects &lt;of&gt; our worldly
desire; but there is no danger whatever in destroying
the growing soft and tender desires of the mind. (It is
easier to govern one’s self than to suppress his enemies).</p>

<p class='c009'>38. What is good, and what is not so, is well known for certain
even to boys; (<i>i.e.</i> the immutability of good and evil is
plain to common and simple understandings); therefore employ
your mind to what is good, as they train up children in the paths
of goodness. (Sow good betimes, to reap its reward in time. If
good we plant not, vice will fill the place; and rankest weeds,
the richest soils deface).</p>

<p class='c009'>39. Our minds are as inveterate and indomitable, as ferocious
lions of the forest; and they are true victors, who have
conquered these, and are thereby entitled to salvation. (Govern
your restless mind, and you govern the rest of your kind).</p>

<p class='c009'>40. Our desires are as fierce lions, with their insatiable thirst
after lucre: and they are as delusive as the mirage of the desert,
by leading us to dangers.</p>

<p class='c009'>41. The man that is devoid of desires, cares for nothing,
whether the winds may howl with the fury of storms; or the
seas break their bounds, or the twelve suns (of the Zodiac)
rise at once to burn the universe.</p>

<p class='c009'>42. The mind is the root, that grows the plants of our good
and evil and all our weal and woe. The mind is the tree of
the world, and all peoples are as its branches and leaves,
(which live by its sap and juice).</p>

<p class='c009'>43. One prospers every where, who has freed his mind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>from its desires; and he that lives in the dominion of
indifference, rests in his heavenly felicity.</p>

<p class='c009'>44. The more we curb the desires of our minds, the greater
we feel our inward happiness; as the fire being extinguished,
we find ourselves cooled from its heat.</p>

<p class='c009'>45. Should the mind long for millions of worldly mansions in
its highest ambition; it is sure to have them spread out to view
within the minute particle of its own essence. (The ambitious
mind grasps the whole world within its small compass).</p>

<p class='c009'>46. Opulence in expectancy, is full of anxiety to the mind,
and the expected wealth when gained is no less troublesome
to it; but the treasure of contentment is fraught with lasting
peace of mind, therefore be victorious over your greedy mind
by abandonment of all your desires.</p>

<p class='c009'>47. With the highly holy virtue of your unmindfulness, and
with the even-mindedness of those that have known the Divine
spirit; as also with the subdued, moderated and defeated
yearnings of your heart, make the state of the increate One as
your own. (Sedateness of the mind, resembles the state of God).</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. Means of weakening the mind and mental Desires.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> continued:—Whatever be the nature of the
object of any man’s desire, his mind does not fail
to run after it with great avidity in every place.
 </p>

<p class='c009'>2. This eagerness of the mind rises and sets by turns, with
the view of the desired object, like the clear bubbles of water
foaming and bursting of themselves with the breath of winds.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. As coldness is the nature of frost, and blackness is that
of ink; so is swiftness or momentum the nature of the mind,
as stillness is that of the soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Ráma said:—Tell me sir, why the mind is identified with
momentum, and what is the cause of its velocity; tell me
also; if there is any other force to impede the motion of
the mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Vasishtha replied:—We have never seen the motionless
quiet of the mind; fleetness is the nature of the mind,
as heat is that of fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. This vacillating power of motion, which is implanted in
the mind, is known to be of the same nature as that of the
self-motive force of the Divine mind; which is the cause of
the momentum and motion of those worlds.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. As the essence of air is imperceptible without its vibration,
so we can have no notion of the momentum of our minds, apart
from the idea of their oscillation.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. The mind which has no motion is said to be dead and defunct;
and the suspension of mental agitation, is the condition of Yoga
quietism and leading to our ultimate liberation.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. The mortification of the mind, is attended with the subsidence
of our woes; but the agitated thoughts in the mind, are causes of
all our woes.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>10. The monster of the mind, being roused from its rest, raises
all our dangers and disasters; but its falling into rest and
inaction, causes our happiness and perfect felicity.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. The restlessness of the mind is the effect of its ignorance;
therefore Ráma! exert your reason to destroy all its desires (for
temporal possessions).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. Destroy the internal desires of your mind, which are
raised by ignorance alone; and attain your supreme felicity
by your resignation to the divine will.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. The mind is a thing that stands between the real and
unreal and between intelligence and dull matter, and is
moved to and fro by the contending powers on either side.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. Impelled by dull material force, the mind is lost in the
investigation of material objects; till at last by its habitual
thought of materiality, it is converted to a material object,
resembling dull matter itself. (Such is the materialistic mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>15. But the mind being guided by its intellectual powers, to
the investigation of abstract truths, becomes an intelligent and
intellectual principle, by its continued practice of thinking
itself as such. (This is immaterial mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>16. It is by virtue of the exertion of your manly powers
and activities, and by force of constant habit and continued
practice; that you can succeed to attain any thing, to which,
you employ your mind with diligence. (Diligence overcomes all
difficulties).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. You can also be free from fears, and find your rest in
your reliance in the sorrowless Being; provided you exercise
your manly activities therein, and curb the proclivities of
your mind by your intelligence.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. It must be by the force of your intelligent mind, that
you must lift up your deluded mind, which is drowned in the
cares of this world. There is no other means that will help
you to do so.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. The mind only is capable of subduing the mind; for
who can subdue a king unless he is a king himself?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>20. Our minds are the boats, to lift us from the ocean of this
world; where we are carried too far by its beating waves, and
thrown into the eddies of despair, and where we are caught by
the sharks of our greediness.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. Let your own mind cut the net of the mind, which is
ensnared in this world; and extricate your soul, by this wise
policy, which is the only means of your liberation. (<i>i.e.</i> Set
your mind to correct your mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. Let the wise destroy the desires of their minds, and
this will set them free from the bonds of ignorance.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. Shun your desire for earthly enjoyments and forsake
your knowledge of dualism; then get rid of your impressions
of entity and non-entity, and be happy with the knowledge of
one unity.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. The thought of the unknowable, will remove the thoughts of
knowables; this is equivalent to the destruction of desires,
of the mind and ignorance also.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. The unknown one of which we are unconscious by our
knowledge, transcends all whatever is known to us by our
consciousness. Our unconsciousness is our <i>nirvána</i> or
final extinction, while our consciousness is the cause of our woe.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. It is by their own attention that men soon come to the knowledge
of the knowables; but it is the unknowing or unconsciousness
of these that is our <i>nirvána</i>, while our consciousness is the
cause of our woe. (Want of self-consciousness, is want of pain.
And perfect apathy is the perfection of solipsism).</p>

<p class='c009'>27. Destroy O Ráma, whatever is desirable to your mind, and is
the object of your affection; then knowing them as reduced
to nothing, forsake your desires as seedless sprouts (which
can never grow); and live content without the feelings of joy
and grief.</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. Extirpation of Evil Desires and duality
by the true knowledge of unity called the Vidyá.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> continued:—The false desires which continually
rise in the breast; are as the appearances of false moons
in the sky, and should be shunned by the wise.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. They rise in the minds of the unwise amidst their ignorance;
but every thing which is known only by its name and not in
actuality, can not have its residence in the minds of wise
people. (Nominalism as opposed to Realistic Platonism).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Be wise, O Ráma; and do not think like the ignorant; but
consider well all that I tell you;—there is no second moon
in the sky, but it appears so only by deception of our optical
visions.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. There exists nothing real or unreal any where, except the
only true essence of God; as there is no substantiality in the
continuity of the waves, besides the body of waters.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. There is no reality in any thing, whether existent or
non-existent, all which are mere creations of your shadowy
ideality; do not therefore impute any shape or figure to the
eternal, boundless and pure spirit of God.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. You are no maker nor master of anything, then why
deem any act or thing as your own (<i>mamatá—meity</i>?) You know
not what these existences are, and by whom and wherefore they
are made.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Neither think yourself as actor, because no actor can
attempt to do anything. Discharge whatever is your duty,
and remain at your ease with having done your part.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Though you are the actor of an action, yet think not
yourself as such, minding your inability to do or undo any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>thing: for how can you boast yourself as the actor, when you
know your inability for action.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. If truth is delectable and untruth is odious, then remain
firm to what is good; and be employed in your duties (in the
path of truth and goodness).</p>

<p class='c009'>10. But as the whole world is a gallery, a magic and an unreality;
then say what reliance is there in it, and what signifies
pleasurableness or unpleasurableness to any body.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. Know Ráma, this ovum of the world to be a delusion, and
being inexistent in itself, appears as a real existence to
others.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. Know this busy sphere of the world, which is so full
with its inessence; to be an ideal phantasm presented for
the delusion of our minds.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. It is like the beautiful bamboo plant, all hollow within,
and without pith and marrow in the inside; and like the curling
waves of the sea, both of which are born to perish without being
uprooted from the bottom. (It is impossible to root out the
bamboo as well as the rising wave of the water).</p>

<p class='c009'>14. This world is as volatile as the air and water flying in
the air, and hardly to be tangible or held fast in the hand;
and as precipitous as the water-fall in its course (hurling
down and sweeping away everything before it).</p>

<p class='c009'>15. It appears as a flowery garden, but never comes to any
good use at all; so the billowy sea in the mirage, presents
the form of water, without allaying our thirst.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. Sometimes it seems to be straight, and at others a
curve; now it is long and now short, and now it is moving
and quiet again; and everything in it, though originally
for our good, conspires to our evil only.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. Though hollow in the inside, the world appears to be full
with its apparent contents; and though all the worlds are
continually in motion, yet they seem to be standing still.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. Whether they be dull matter or intelligences, their
existence depends upon their motion; and these without stopping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>any where for a moment, present the sight of their being quite
at rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. Though they are as bright as light to sight, they are
as opaque as the dark coal in their bowels; and though they
are moved by a superior power, they appear to be moving of
themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. They fade away before the brighter light of the sun,
but brighten in the darkness of the night; their light is
like that of the mirage, by reflection of sunbeams.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. Human avarice is as a sable serpent, crooked and venomous,
thin and soft in its form; but rough and dangerous in its
nature, and ever unsteady as a woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>22. Our love of the world, ceases soon without the objects
of our affection; as the lamp is extinguished without its oil,
and as the vermilion mark, which is soon effaced. (Here is a
pun upon the world <i>sneha</i> meaning a fluid substance as well as
affection; and that the world is a dreary waste, without the
objects dear to us).</p>

<p class='c009'>23. Our false hopes are as transient, as the evanescent
flash of lightnings; they glare and flare for a moment, but
they disappear in the air as these transitory flashes of light.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. The objects of our desire are often had without our seeking;
but they are as frail as the fire of heaven; they appear to
vanish like the twinkling lightnings, and being held carefully
in the hand, they burn it like the electric fire. (This passage
shows the science of electricity and the catching of electric fire,
to have been known to the ancients).</p>

<p class='c009'>25. Many things come to us unasked, and though appearing
delightsome at first, they prove troublesome to us at last.
Hopes delayed, are as flowers growing out of season, which,
neither bear their fruits, nor answer our purposes.
(Unseasonal flowers are held as ominous and useless).</p>

<p class='c009'>26. Every accident tends to our misery, as unpleasant
dreams infest our sleep and disturb our rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. It is our delusion (avidyá), that presents these many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>and big worlds before us; as our dreams produce, sustain
and destroy all the appearances of vision in one minute.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. It was delusion which made one minute, appear as many
years to king Lavana; and the space of one night, seem as
the long period of a dozen of years to Haris chandra.</p>

<p class='c009'>29. Such also is the case with separated lovers among rich
people, that a single night seems as a live long year to them,
in the absence of their beloved.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. It is this delusive <i>avidyá</i>, that shortens the flight
of time to the rich and happy; and prolongs its course, with the
poor and miserable: all of whom are subject to the power of
delusion <i>vipary’ása</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. The power of this delusion is essentially spread over all the
works of creation, as the light of a lamp, is spread over things
in its effulgence and not in substance.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. As a female form represented in a picture is no woman, and
has not the power of doing any thing; so this <i>avidyá</i> which
presents us the shapes of our desired objects in the picture of
the mind, can produce nothing in reality.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. The delusion consists in the building of aerial castles in
the mind, without their substance; and though these appear in
hundreds and thousands of shapes, they have no substantiality
in them.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. It deludes the ignorant, as a mirage misleads the deer
in a desert; but it can not deceive the knowing man by its
false appearances.</p>

<p class='c009'>35. These appearances like the foaming waters, are as continuous
as they are evanescent, they are as fleeting as the driving frost,
which can not be held in the hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. This delusion holds the world in its grasp, and flies aloft
with it in the air; it blinds us by the flying dust, which is
raised by its furious blasts. (This is delusion of ambitions).</p>

<p class='c009'>37. Covered with dust and with heat and sweat of its body, it
grasps the earth and flies all about the world. The deluded
man ever toils and moils, and runs every where after his greed.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>38. As the drops of rain water, falling from the clouds, form
the great rivers and seas; and as the scattered straws being
tied together, make the strong rope for the bondage of beasts;
so the combination of all the delusive objects in the world, makes
the great delusion of Máyá and Moha. (‘<i>Gutta cum gutta facit
lacum</i>’. Drop by drop, makes a lake. Or by drops the lake is
drained. And many a little, makes a mickle).</p>

<p class='c009'>39. The poets describe the fluctuations of the world as a series
of waves and the world itself, as a bed of lotuses: pleasant to
sight, but floating on the unstable element. But I compare it
with the porous stalk of the lotus, which is full of perforations
and foramens inside; and as a pool of mud and mire, with the filth
of our sins. (The world is full of hidden traps and trapdoors and
is a pit of sinfulness).</p>

<p class='c009'>40. Men think much of their improvement, and of many other things
on earth; but there is no improving in this decaying world; which
is as a tempting cake with a coating of sweets, but full of deadly
gall within.</p>

<p class='c009'>41. It is as an extinguishing lamp, whose flame is lost and
fled we know not where. It is visible as a mist, but try to
lay hold on it, and it proves to be nothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>42. This earth is a handful of ashes, which being flung aloft
flies in particles of dust; and the upper sky which appears
to be blue, has no blueness in it.</p>

<p class='c009'>43. There is the same delusion here on earth, as in the
appearance of couple of moons in the sky; and in the vision of
things in a dream, as also in the motion of immovable things on
the land, to the passenger in a boat. (Things taken to be true,
prove to be false).</p>

<p class='c009'>44. Men being long deluded by this error, which has fastly
laid hold of their minds, imagine a long duration of the
world, as they do of the scenes in their dreams.</p>

<p class='c009'>45. The mind being thus deluded by this error, sees the wonderful
productions of world, to rise and fall within itself like the
waves of the sea.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>46. Things which are real and good, appear as otherwise in
our error; while those that are unreal and noxious, appear
as real and good to our deluded understandings.</p>

<p class='c009'>47. Our strong avarice riding on the vehicle of the desired
object, chases the fleeting mind as bird-catchers do the
flying birds in nets.</p>

<p class='c009'>48. Delusion like a mother and wife often offers us fresh
delights, with her tender looks and breasts distilling sweet
milk.</p>

<p class='c009'>49. But these delights serve only to poison us, while they seem
to cool the worlds with their distillation; just as the crescent
orb of the moon, injures us with too much of her moistening
influence, while it appears to refresh us with her full
bright beams.</p>

<p class='c009'>50. Blind delusion turns the meek, mild and mute men, to
giddy and vociferous fools; as the silent Vetálas become in
their revelrous dancings, amidst the silent woods at night.</p>

<p class='c009'>51. It is under the influence of delusion, that we see the
shapes of snakes and serpents, in our brick-built and stone made
houses at night falls: (<i>i.e.</i> apprehensions of these in darkness).</p>

<p class='c009'>52. It makes a single thing appear as double, as in the
sight of two moons in the sky; and brings near to us whatever
is at a distance, as in our dreams; and even causes us to dream
ourselves as dead in sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>53. It causes the long to appear as short, as our nightly
sleep shortens the duration of time; and makes a moment
appear as a year, as in the case of separated lovers.</p>

<p class='c009'>54. Look at the power of this unsubstantial ignorance, a
negative thing, and still there is nothing which it can
not alter to some thing else.</p>

<p class='c009'>55. Therefore be diligent to stop the course of this delusion,
by your right knowledge: as they dry up a channel by stopping
the current of the stream.</p>

<p class='c009'>56. Ráma said:—It is wonderful that a false conception, which
has no real existence, and is so delicate as almost a nothing
(but a name) should thus blind the understanding.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>57. It is strange that something without form or figure,
without sense or understanding, and which is unreal and
vanishing, should so blindfold the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>58. It is strange that a thing sparkling in darkness, and
vanishing in day light, and mope-eyed as the moping owl,
should thus keep the world in darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'>59. It is strange that something prone to the doing of evil
(deception), and unable to come to light and flying from sight,
and having no bodily form whatever, should thus darken the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>60. It is a wonder that one acting so miserly, and consorting
with the mean and vile, and ever hiding herself in darkness,
should thus domineer over the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>61. It is wonderful that fallacy which is attended with
incessant woe and peril, and which is devoid of sense and
knowledge, should keep the world in darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'>62. It is to be wondered that error arising from anger and
avarice, creeping crookedly in darkness, and liable to instant
death (by its detection), should yet keep the world in blindness.</p>

<p class='c009'>63. It is surprising that error which is a blind, dull and
stupid thing itself, and which is falsely talkative at all
times, should yet mislead others in the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>64. It is astonishing, that falsehood should betray a man, after
attaching so close to him as his consort, and showing all her
endearments to him; but flying at the approach of his reason.</p>

<p class='c009'>65. It is strange that man should be blinded by the womanish
attire of error, which beguiles the man but dares not to
look at him face to face.</p>

<p class='c009'>66. It is strange that man is blinded by his faithless consort
of error, which has no sense nor intelligence, and which dies
away without being killed.</p>

<p class='c009'>67. Tell me Sir, how this error is to be dispelled, which has its
seat in the desires, and is deeply rooted in the recesses of the
heart and mind, and lead us to the channels of endless misery,
by subjecting us to repeated births and deaths, and to the pains
and pleasures of life.</p>

Argument. Spiritual knowledge, the only means of
dispelling worldly errors, temporal desires and cares.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">R</span>áma</span> repeated:—Tell me sir, how this stony blindness of man,
is to be removed, which is caused by the train of ignorance
or delusion called <i>avidyá</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Vasishtha replied:—As the particles of snow, melt away
at the sight of the sun, so is this ignorance dispelled in
a moment, by a glance of the holy spirit.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Till then doth ignorance continue to hurl down the soul
and spirit, as from a precipice to the depths of the world,
and expose them to woes, as thick as thorny brambles.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. As long as the desire of seeing the spirit, does not rise
of itself in the human soul, so long there is no end of this
ignorance (<i>avidyá</i>) and insensibility (<i>Moha</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. The sight of the supreme Spirit, destroys the knowledge
of our self-existence, which is caused by our ignorance; as
the light of the sun, destroys the shadows of things.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. The sight of the all-pervading God, dispels our ignorance
in the same manner, as the light of the twelve zodiacal suns
(all shining at once), puts the shadows of night to flight
from all sides of the horizon.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Our desires are the offspring of our ignorance, and the
annihilation of these constitutes what we call our liberation;
because the man that is devoid of desires, is reckoned the
perfect and consummate Siddha.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. As the night-shade of desires, is dissipated from the
region of the mind; the darkness of ignorance is put to flight,
by the rise of the intellectual sun (<i>Vivekodaya</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>9. As the dark night flies away before the advance of solar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>light, so does ignorance disappear, before the advancement
of true knowledge—<i>Viveka.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>10. The stiffness of our desires, tends to bind the mind
fast in its worldly chains; as the advance of night serves
to increase the fear of goblins in children.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. Ráma asked:—The knowledge of the phenomenals as true,
makes what we call <i>avidyá</i> or ignorance, and it is said
to be dispersed by spiritual knowledge. Now tell me sir,
what is the nature of the Spirit.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. Vasishtha replied:—That which is not the subject of
thought, which is all-pervasive, and the thought of which
is beyond expression and comprehension is the universal
spirit (which we call our Lord and God).</p>

<p class='c009'>13. That which reaches, to the highest empyrean of God, and
stretches over the lowest plots of grass on earth, is the
all-pervading spirit at all times, and unknown to the
ignorant soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. All this is verily Brahma, eternal and imperishable
intelligence. To him no imagination of the mind can reach
at any time.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. That which is never born or dead, and which is
ever-existent in all worlds, and in which the conditions of
being and change are altogether wanting.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. Which is one and one alone, all and all pervading, and
imperishable Unity; which is incomprehensible in thought, and
is only of the form of Intellect, is the universal Spirit.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. It is accompanied with the ever-existent, all-extending, pure
and undisturbed Intellect, and is that calm, quiet, even and
unchanging state of the soul, which is called the Divine Spirit.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. There resides also the impure mind, which is in its
nature beyond all physical objects, and runs after its
own desire; it is conceivable by the Intellect as sullied
by its own activity.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. This ubiquious, all-potent, great and godlike mind,
separates itself in its imagination from the Supreme spirit,
and rises from it as a wave on the surface of the sea. (So
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>the Sruti:—<i>Etasmat Jayate pranahmanah</i> &amp;c. The life and
mind have their rise from Him).</p>

<p class='c009'>20. There is no fluctuation (<i>Sansriti</i>) nor projection (<i>Vikshepa</i>)
in the all-extending tranquil soul of God; but these take place
in the mind owing to its desires, which cause its production
of all things in the world. (Hence the world and all things in
it, are creations of the divine and active mind, and not of the
inactive Supreme Soul).</p>

<p class='c009'>21. Therefore the world being the production of desire or will,
has its extinction with the privation of desires; for that
which comes the growth of a thing, causes its extinction also;
as the wind which kindles the fire, extinguishes it likewise.
(Here is a coincidence with the Homœpathic maxim <i>Similes per
similibus</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. The exertion of human efforts, gives rise to the expectation
of fruition, but want of desire, causes the cessation of exertions;
and consequently puts a stop to the desire of employment,
together with our ignorance causing the desire.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. The thought that ‘I am distinct from Brahma’, binds
the mind to the world; but the belief that ‘Brahma is all’
releases the mind from its bondage.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. Every thought about one’s self, fastens his bondage in
this world; but release from selfish thoughts, leads him to
his liberation. Cease from thy selfish cares, and thou shalt
cease to toil and moil for naught.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. There is no lake of lotuses in the sky, nor is there a
lotus growing in the gold mine, whose fragrance fills the
air, and attracts the blue bees to suck its honey.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. The goddess of ignorance—Avidyá, with her uplifted arms
resembling the long stalks of lotus plants, laughs in exultation
over her conquests, with the glaring light of shining moonbeams.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. Such is the net of our wishes spread before us by our
minds, which represent unrealities as real, and take a
delight to dwell upon them, like children in their toys.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>28. So also is the snare spread out by our own ignorance, all
over this world, that it ensnares the busy people to their
misery in all places, as it binds fast the ignorant men and
boys in its chains.</p>

<p class='c009'>29. Men are busied in worldly affairs with such thoughts, as
these that, ‘I am poor and bound in this earth for my life;
but I have my hands and feet wherewith I must work for myself’.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. But they are freed from all affairs of this life, who know
themselves as spiritual beings, and their spiritual part is
neither subject to bondage nor labour. (They know themselves
to be bodiless, in their embodied forms).</p>

<p class='c009'>31. The thought that ‘I am neither flesh nor bones, but some
thing else than my body,’ releases one from his bondage; and
one having such assurance in him, is said to have weakened
his <i>avidyá</i> or ignorance.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. Ignorance (<i>avidyá</i>) is painted in the imagination of
earthly men, to be as dark as the darkness which surrounds the
highest pinnacle of Meru, blazing with the blue light of sapphire,
or at the primeval darkness impenetrable by the solar light.
(Hence ignorance and darkness are used as synonymous terms).</p>

<p class='c009'>33. It is also represented by earth-born mortals, as the blackness
which naturally covers the face of heaven by its own nature like
the blue vault of the sky. (Thus Avidya is represented as the
black and the blue goddess Kali).</p>

<p class='c009'>34. Thus ignorance is pictured with a visible form, in the
imagination of the unenlightened; but the enlightened never
attribute sensible qualities to inanimate and imaginary objects.</p>

<p class='c009'>35. Ráma said:—Tell me sir, what is the cause of the blueness
of the sky, if it is not the reflexion of the blue gems on the
Meru’s peak, nor is it a collection of darkness by itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. Vasishtha replied:—Ráma! the sky being but empty
vacuum, cannot have the quality of blueness which is commonly
attributed to it; nor is it the bluish lustre of the blue gems
which are supposed to abound on the top of Meru.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>37. There is neither the possibility of a body of darkness
to abide in the sky, when the mundane egg is full of light
(which has displaced the primeval darkness); and when the nature
of light is the brightness which stretches over the extramundane
regions. (This is the zodiacal light reaching to extramundane
worlds).</p>

<p class='c009'>38. O fortunate Ráma! the firmament (súnya) which is a vast
vacuum, is open to a sister of ignorance (avidyá) with regard
to its inward hollowness. (The sky and ignorance are twin
sisters, both equally blank and hollow within, and of unlimited
extent, enveloping the worlds within their unconscious wombs).</p>

<p class='c009'>39. As one after losing his eyesight, beholds but darkness
only all about him; so the want of the objects of sight in the
womb of vacuity, gives the sky the appearance of a darksome
scene.</p>

<p class='c009'>40. By understanding this, as you come to the knowledge, that
the apparent blackness of the sky, is no black colour of its
own; so you come to learn the seeming darkness of ignorance
to be no darkness in reality (but a figurative expression
derived from its similitude to the other).</p>

<p class='c009'>41. Want of desire or its indifference, is the destroyer of
ignorance; and it is as easy to effect it, as to annihilate
the lotus-lake in the sky (an Utopia or a castle built in
the air, being but an airy nothing).</p>

<p class='c009'>42. It is better, O good Ráma! to distrust the delusions
of this world, and disbelieve the blueness of the sky,
than to labour under the error of their reality.</p>

<p class='c009'>43. The thought that ‘I am dead,’ makes one as sorrowful,
as when he dreams of his death in sleep; so also the thought
that ‘I am living’ makes one as cheerful, as when he wakes
from the deadly dream of his death-like sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>44. Foolish imaginations make the mind as stolid as that of a fool;
but reasonable reflexions lead it to wisdom and clearsightedness.</p>

<p class='c009'>45. A moment’s reflexion of the reality of the world and of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>own essence, casts a man into the gloom of everlasting ignorance,
while his forgetfulness of these, removes all mortal thoughts
from his mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>46. Ignorance is the producer of passions and tempter to all
transient objects; it is busy in destroying the knowledge of the
soul, and is destroyed by knowledge of the soul only. (Ignorance
leads to materialism, but it is lost under spiritual knowledge).</p>

<p class='c009'>47. Whatever is sought by the mind, is instantly supplied
by the organs of action; which serve as ministers subservient
to the orders of their king. (The body serves the mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>48. Hence who so does not attend to the dictates of his mind,
in the pursuit of sensible objects, entertains the tranquility
of his inmost soul, by his diligent application to spirituality.</p>

<p class='c009'>49. What did not exist at first, has no existence even now (i.e.
material objects); and these that appear as existent, are no
other than the quiescent and immaculate essence—Brahma himself.
(The eternal is ever existent, and the instantaneous are
but the phases and fluctuations of the everlasting).</p>

<p class='c009'>50. Let no other thought of any person or thing, or of any
place or object employ your mind at any time, except that of
the immutable, everlasting and unlimited spirit of Brahma.
(For what faith or reliance is there in things that are false
and fleeting).</p>

<p class='c009'>51. Rely in the superior powers of your understanding, and
exert your sovran intellect (to know the truth); and root out
at once all worldly desire by enjoyment of the pleasures of your
mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>52. The great ignorance that rises in the mind and raises the
desires of thy heart, has spread the net of thy false hopes
for thy ruin, causing thy death and decrepitude under them.</p>

<p class='c009'>53. Thy wishes burst out in expressions as these that, “these
are my sons and these my treasures; I am such a one, and these
things are mine.” All this is the effect of a magic spell of
ignorance, that binds thee fast in it.</p>

<p class='c009'>54. Thy body is a void, wherein thy desires have produced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>all thy selfish thoughts; as the empty winds raise the gliding
waves on the surface of the sea (resembling the fleeting moments
in the infinity of the Deity).</p>

<p class='c009'>55. Learn ye that are seekers of truth, that the words: I,
mine and this and that, are all meaningless in their true
sense; and that there is nothing that may be called real at
any time, except the knowledge of the true self and essence
of Brahma.</p>

<p class='c009'>56. The heavens above and the earth below, with all the ranges
of hills and mountains on earth, and all the lines of its rivers
and lakes, are but the dissolving views of our sight, and are
seen in the same or different lights as they are represented
by our ignorance. (This is a tenet of the <i>drishtisrishti</i> system
of philosophy, which maintains Visual creations or existence of
phenomenals, to be dependant upon sight or visual organs and
are <i>deceptio visus</i> or fallacies of vision only).</p>

<p class='c009'>57. The phenomenals rise to view from our ignorance, and
disappear before the light of knowledge (as the dreams and
spectres of the dark, are put to flight before the rising
sun-light). They appear in various forms in the substratum
of the soul, as the fallacy of a snake appearing in the
substance of a rope.</p>

<p class='c009'>58. Know Ráma, that the ignorant only are liable to the error,
of taking the earth and sun and the stars, for realities;
but not so the learned, to whom the Great Brahma is present
in all his majesty and full glory, in all places and things.</p>

<p class='c009'>59. While the ignorant labour under the doubt of the two
ideas, of a rope and a snake in the rope; the learned are firm
in their belief, and sight of one true God in all things.</p>

<p class='c009'>60. Do not therefore think as the ignorant do, but consider
all things well like the wise and the learned. Forsake your
earthly wishes, and do not <a id="grovel"></a>grovel like the vulgar by believing
the unself as the self. (The second clause has the double sense
of mistaking an alien as your own, and of taking an unreality
for the true God).</p>

<p class='c009'>61. Of what good is this dull and dumb body to you, Ráma?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>(in your future state), that you are so overcome by your
alternate joy and grief at its pleasure and pain?</p>

<p class='c009'>62. As the wood of a tree and its gum resin, and its fruit
and seed, are not one and the same thing, though they are
so closely akin to one another; so is this body and the
embodied being, quite separate from one another, though
they are so closely united with each other.</p>

<p class='c009'>63. As the burning of a pair of bellows, does not blow out
the fire, nor stop the air blown by another pair, so the vital
air is not destroyed by destruction of the body, but finds its
way into another form and frame elsewhere. (This is the doctrine
of the transmigration of the soul and life in other bodies).</p>

<p class='c009'>64. The thought that ‘I am happy or miserable,’ is as false
as the conception of water in the mirage:—and knowing it
as such, give up your misconceptions of pleasure and pain,
and place your reliance in the sole truth.</p>

<p class='c009'>65. O how wonderful is it, that men have so utterly forgotten
the true Brahmá, and have placed their reliance in false
ignorance (<i>avidyá</i>), the sole cause of errors.</p>

<p class='c009'>66. Do not, O Ráma! give way to ignorance in your mind,
which being overspread by its darkness, will render it
difficult for you to pass over the errors of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>67. Know ignorance to be a false fiend and deluder of the
strongest minds; it is the baneful cause of endless woes,
and producer of the poisonous fruits of illusion.</p>

<p class='c009'>68. It imagines hell fire, in the cooling beams of the watery
orb of the moon; and conceives the torments of the infernal
fires, proceeding from the refreshing beams of that celestial
light. (This passage alludes to the poetical description of moon light
as a flame of fire, in respect to a lover, who is impatient
at the separation of his beloved, and is burning under the
inextinguishable flame of ardent desire).</p>

<p class='c009'>69. It views a dry desert in the wide waters, beating with
billows and undulating with the fragrance of the aqueous <i>kalpa</i>
flowers; and imagines a dry mirage in the empty clouds of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>autumn. (This alludes also to the wild imageries of poets,
proceeding from their false imagination and ignorance).</p>

<p class='c009'>70. Ignorance builds the imaginary castles in empty air, and
causes the error of rising and falling towers in the clouds; it
is the delusion of our fancy, that makes us feel the emotions
of pleasure and pain in our dreams.</p>

<p class='c009'>71. If the mind is not filled and led away by worldly desires,
there is no fear then of our falling into the dangers, which
the day-dreams of our earthly affairs incessantly present
before us.</p>

<p class='c009'>72. The more does our false knowledge (error) lay hold of
our minds, the more we feel the torments of hell and its
punishments in us, as one dreams of night-mares in his sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>73. The mind being pierced by error as by the thorny stalk of
a lotus, sees the whole world revolving before it like the sea
rolling with its waves.</p>

<p class='c009'>74. Ignorance taking possession of the mind, converts the
enthroned princes to peasants; and reduces them to a condition
worse than that of beastly huntsmen. (All tyrants are the
creatures of ignorance).</p>

<p class='c009'>75. Therefore, Ráma! give up the earthly desires, that serve
at best to bind down the (celestial) soul to this mortal earth
and its mortifying cares; and remain as the pure and white
crystal, with reflecting the hues of all things around in your
stainless mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>76. Employ thy mind to thy duties, without being tarnished
by thy attachment to any; but remain as the unsullied crystal,
receiving the reflections of outward objects, without being
stained by any.</p>

<p class='c009'>77. Knowing everything with avidity in thy watchful mind, and
performing all thy duties with due submission, and keeping
from the common track with thy exalted mind, thou wilt
raise thyself above comparison with any other person.</p>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>álmíki</span> relates:—Being thus admonished by the high
minded Vasishtha, the lotus eyes of Ráma became unfolded
as new-blown flowers.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. He with his expanded heart and blooming face, shone forth
with a pure grace, like the fresh lotus reviving at the end
of night, under the vivifying beams of the rising sun.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. His smiling countenance shone forth as the shining moon,
with his inward enlightenment and wonder; and then with the
nectarious beams of his bright and white pearly teeth, he
spoke out these words.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Ráma said:—O wonder! that the want of ignorance should
subdue all things, as if it were to bind the huge hills with the
thin threads of lotus stalks. (Wondrous achievements of science).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. O! that this straw of the earth, which shows itself to be
so compact a body in the world; is no more than the production
of our ignorance, which shows the unreal as a reality.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Tell me further for my enlightenment regarding the true
nature of this magical earth, which rolls as a ceaseless
stream, running amidst the etherial worlds.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. There is another great doubt that infests my breast, and
it is with regard to the state which attended on the fortunate
Lavana at last.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Tell me moreover regarding the embodied soul and the
animated body, whether they are in concord or discord
with one another, and which of them is the active agent
and recipient of the rewards of acts in this earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. Tell me also who was that sorcerer and where he fled,
after putting the good prince Lavana to all his tribulation,
and then restoring him to his former exalted position.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>10. Vasishtha said:—The body is as a frame of wood work, and
contains nothing (spiritual) in it; it receives the reflexion
of an intelligence in it as in a dream, and this is called the mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. This mind becomes the living principal (life), and is
endued with the power of thinking also. It is as unstable as
a boat on the current of world of affairs, and plays the part
of a fickle monkey, amidst the busy castle of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. The active principle in the body, is known under
the several appellations of the mind, life and egoism
(or consciousness); and having a body for its abode,
is employed in a variety of actions.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. This principle is subject to endless pains and pleasures
in its unenlightened or unawakened state, and the body bears
no relation with them. (The mind is the perceptive and sensitive
principle and not the body).</p>

<p class='c009'>14. The unenlightened understanding again has received
many fictitious names, according to the various faculties
which it exhibits in its acts.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. As long as the unawakened mind is in its sleeping state,
it perceives the busy bustle of the world as it were in his
dream, and which is unknown to the waking or enlightened mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. As long as the living being is not awakened from its
dormancy, so long it has to labour under the inseparable
mist of worldly errors.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. But the darkness over-hanging on the minds of the enlightened,
is as soon put to flight as the shade of night overspreading the
bed of lotuses, is dispersed at sun rise.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. That which is called the heart, the mind, the living soul,
ignorance and desire by the learned, and what is also styled the
principle of action, is the same embodied being that is subject
both to the feelings of pleasure and pain.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. The body is dull matter and is insensible of pain and
pleasure; it is the embodied being, which is said to be subject
to these by men of right reason: and this by reason of its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>impervious ignorance and irrationality, is the cause of its own
misery.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. The living soul is the subject of its good and bad actions;
but it becomes confined in its body by reason of its irrationality,
and remains pent up there like the silkworm in its cocoon.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. The mind being fast bound to its ignorance, exerts its
faculties in various ways, and turns round like a wheel in
its various pursuits and employments.</p>

<p class='c009'>22. It is the mind dwelling in the body, that makes it to
rise and set, to eat and drink, to walk and go, and to hurt and
kill, all which are acts of the mind, and not of the body.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. As the master of the house does his many acts in it, and
not the house itself; so the mind acts its several parts in
the body, and not the body by itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. The mind is the active and passive agent of all the
actions and passions, and of the pains and pleasures of
the body; and it is the mind only that makes the man.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. Hear me now tell you the useful moral of the story of
Lavana; and how he was transformed to a Chandála, by
derangement of his mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. The mind has to feel the effects of its actions whether
good or evil; and in order that you may understand it well,
hear attentively what I will now relate unto you.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. Lavana who was born of the line of king Harischandra,
thought within himself one day, as he was sitting apart
from all others of his court.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. My grand-father was a great king and performed the
Rájasúya sacrifice in act; and I, being born of his line,
must perform the same in my mind (<i>i.e.</i> mentally).</p>

<p class='c009'>29. Having determined so, and getting the things ready for
the sacrifice, he entered the sacrificial hall for his
initiation in the sacred rites.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. He called the sacrificial priests, and honoured the holy saints;
he invited the gods to it, and kindled the sacrificial fire.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>31. Having performed the sacrifice to his heart’s content,
and honoured the gods, sages and Bráhmans; he went to a
forest to reside there for a year.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. Having then made presents of all his wealth to Bráhmans
and other men, he awoke from his slumber in the same
forest by the evening of that day.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. Thus the king Lavana attained the merit of the sacrifice, in
his internal satisfaction of having attained the meritoriousness
of the sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. Hence learn to know the mind to be the recipient of
pleasure and pain; therefore employ your attention, Ráma!
to the purification of your mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>35. Every man becomes perfect in his mind in its full time
and proper place; but he is utterly lost who believes himself
to be composed of his body only.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. The mind being roused to transcendental reason, all
miseries are removed from the rational understanding; just as
the beams of the rising sun falling upon the lotus-bud, dispel
the darkness that had closely contracted its folded petals.</p>

Argument. Production of the Body from the Mind.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">R</span>áma</span> asked:—What evidence is there sir, in proof of Lavana’s
obtaining the reward of his mental sacrifice of Rájasúya,
in his transformation to the state of the Chandála, as it was
wrought upon him by the enchantment of the magician?
 </p>

<p class='c009'>2. Vasishtha answered:—I was myself present in the court-house
of king Lavana, at the time when the magician made his appearance
there, and I saw all that took place there with my own eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. After the magician had gone and done his work, I with the
other courtiers, was respectfully requested by the king Lavana,
to explain to him the cause (of the dream and its circumstances).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. After I had pondered the matter and clearly seen its
cause, I expounded the meaning of the magician’s spell,
in the way as I shall now relate to you, my Ráma!</p>

<p class='c009'>5. I remembered that all the performers of Rájasúya sacrifice,
were subjected to various painful difficulties and dangers,
under which they had to suffer for a full dozen of years.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. It was then that Indra, the lord of heaven had compassion
for Lavana, and sent his heavenly messenger in the form
of the magician to avert his calamity.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. He taxed the Rájasúya sacrificer with the inflictment of
the very many hardships in his dream, and departed in his
aerial journey to the abode of the gods and Siddhas.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. (Prose) Thus Ráma! it is quite evident and there is no
doubt in it. The mind is the active and passive agent of
all kinds of actions and their sequences.</p>

<p class='c009'>(<i>a</i>). Therefore rub out the dirt of your heart, and polish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>the gem of your mind; and having melted it down like the
particle of an icicle, by the fire of your reason, attain
to your chief good <i>summum bonum</i> at last.</p>

<p class='c009'>(<i>b</i>). Know the mind as self-same with ignorance (avidyá),
which presents these multitudes of beings before you, and
produces the endless varieties of things by its magical power.</p>

<p class='c009'>(<i>c</i>). There is no difference in the meanings of the words
ignorance, mind, understanding and living soul, as in the
word tree and all its synonyms.</p>

<p class='c009'>(<i>d</i>). Knowing this truth, keep a steady mind freed from all
its desires; and as the orb of the clear sun of your intellect
has its rise, so the darkness of your <i>nolens</i> and <i>volens</i> flies
away from you.</p>

<p class='c009'>(<i>e</i>). Know also this truth, that there is nothing in the world
which is not to be seen by you, and which can not be made your
own, or alienated from you. Nothing is there that does not
die or what is not yours or others. All things become all at
all times. (This dogma is based on a dictum of the Vedánta
given in the Madhu Bráhmana. That nothing is confined in
any place or person at all times, but passes from one to
another in its turn and time).</p>

<p class='c009'>9. The multitudes of existent bodies and their known properties,
meet together in the substantiality (of the self-same Brahma);
as the various kinds of unburnt clay vessels, are melted down
in the same watery substance.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. Ráma said:—You said sir, that it is by weakening the desires
of our mind, that we can put an end to our pleasures and pains;
but tell me now, how is it possible to stop the course of
our naturally fickle minds.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. Vasishtha replied:—Hear, O thou bright moon of Raghu’s
race! the proper course that I will tell thee for quieting
the restless mind; by knowing this thou shalt obtain the
peace of thy mind, and be freed from the actions of thy
organs of sense.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. I have told you before of the triple nature of the production
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>of beings here below, which I believe, you well remember.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. Of these the first is that power (Brahmá), who assumed
to himself the shape of the Divine Will (Sankalpa), and saw in
his presence whatever he wished to produce, and which brought
the mundane system into existence.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. He thought of many changes in his mind, as those of birth
and death, of pleasure and pain, of the course of nature and
effect of ignorance and the like; and then having ordained
them as he willed, he disappeared of himself as snow before
the solar light.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. Thus this god, the personification of Will, rises and sets
repeatedly, as he is prompted from time to time by his inward
wish. (So does every living being come out of the mould of
its internal desire. Or that:—it is the wish, that frames
and fashions every body, or the will that moulds the mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>16. So there are millions of Brahmás born in this mundane
egg, and many that have gone by and are yet to come, whose
number is innumerable (and who are incarnations of their
desires only).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. So are all living beings in the same predicament with
Brahmá, proceeding continually from the entity of God. Now
I will tell you the manner in which they live, and are
liberated from the bond of life.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. The mental power of Brahmá issuing from him, rests on
the wide expanse of vacuum which is spread before it; then
being joined with the essence of ether, becomes solidified
in the shape of desire.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. Then finding the miniature of matter spread out before
it, it becomes the quintessence of the quintuple elements.
Having assumed afterwards the inward senses, it becomes a
suitable elementary body composed of the finest particles
of the five elements. It enters into grains and vegetables,
which re-enter into the bowels of animals in the form of food.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. The essence of this food in the form of semen, gives
birth to living beings to infinity.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>21. The male child betakes himself in his boy-hood,
to his tutor for the acquisition of knowledge.</p>

<p class='c009'>22. The boy next assumes his wondrous form of
youth, which next arrives to the state of manhood.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. The man afterwards learns to choose something for himself,
and reject others by the clearsightedness of his internal
faculties.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. The man that is possessed of such right discrimination
of good and evil, and of right and wrong, and who is confident
of the purity of his own nature, and of his belonging to the
best caste (of a Brahmán); attains by degrees the supernatural
powers for his own good, as also for the enlightenment of his
mind, by means of his knowledge of the seven essential grounds
of Yoga meditation.</p>

Argument. The septuple grounds of true and false Knowledge and
their mixed modes. And firstly, of self-abstraction or abstract
knowledge of one or <i>swarúpa</i>; and then of the different
grounds of Ignorance.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">R</span>áma</span> said:—Please sir, tell me in brief, what are the grounds of yoga
meditation, which produce the seven kinds of consummation, which are
aimed at by the yogi adepts. You sir, who are best acquainted with all
recondite truths, must know it better than all others.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Vasishtha replied:—They consist of the seven states of ignorance
(ajnána-bhúmi), and as many of knowledge also; and these again
diverge into many others, by their mutual intermixture.
(Participating the natures of one another, and forming the mixed
modes of states of truth and error).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. All these states (both of right and wrong cognitions),
being deep rooted in the nature of man (mahá-satta), either by
his habit or of training, made produce their respective fruits or
results (tending to his elevation or degradation in this world
and the next).</p>

<p class='c009'>Note. Habit or natural disposition (pravritti) is the cause of leading
to ignorance and its resulting error; but good training—<i>sádhana</i>
and better endeavours—<i>prayatna</i>, are the causes of right
knowledge and elevation.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Attend now to the nature of the sevenfold states or
grounds of ignorance; and you will come to know thereby,
the nature of the septuple grounds of knowledge also.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>5. Know this as the shortest lesson, that I will give thee of the
definitions of true knowledge and ignorance; that, it is the
remaining in one’s own true nature (<i>swarúpa</i> or suiform state),
that constitutes his highest knowledge and liberation; and his
divergence from it to the knowledge of his ego (egoism—ahanta),
is the cause of his ignorance, and leads him to the error and
bondage of this world.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Of these, they that do not deviate from their consciousness—samvitti
of themselves—swarúpa, as composed of the pure <i>ens</i> or essence only
(suddha-san-mátra), are not liable to ignorance; because of their want
of passions and affections, and of the feelings of envy and enmity in
them. (The highest intelligence of one’s self, is the consciousness of
his self-existence, or that “I am that I am” as a spiritual being;
because the spirit or soul is the true self).</p>

<p class='c009'>7. But falling off from the consciousness of self-entity—swarúpa,
and diving into the intellect—Chit, in search of the thoughts of
cognizable objects (chetyárthas), is the greatest ignorance and
error of mankind. (No error is greater than to fall off from the
subjective and run after the objective).</p>

<p class='c009'>8. The truce that takes place in the mind, in the interim of
a past and future thought of one object to another (arthadar
thántara); know that respite of the mind in thinking, to be the
resting of the soul, in the consciousness of its self-entity
swarúpa.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. That state of the soul which is at calm after the setting of
the thoughts and desires of the mind; and which is as cold and
quiet as the bosom of a stone, and yet without the torpitude of
slumber or dull drowsiness; is called the supineness of the soul
in its recognition of itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. That state of the soul, which is devoid of its sense of egoism
and destitute of its knowledge of dualism, and its distinction
from the state of the one universal soul, and shines forth with
its unsleeping intelligence, is said to be at rest in itself or
<i>swarúpa</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>11. But this state of the pure and self-intelligent soul, is
obscured by the various states of ignorance, whose grounds you
will now hear me relate unto you. These are the three states
of wakefulness or <i>jágrat</i>, known as the embryonic waking (or
<i>vijajágrat</i>), the ordinary waking, and the intense waking called
the <i>mahajágrat</i>. (<i>i.e.</i> the hypnotism or hybernation of the soul,
being reckoned its intelligent state, its waking is deemed as the
ground of its ignorance, and the more is it awake to the concerns
of life, the more it is said to be liable to error).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. Again the different states of its dreaming (swapnam or somnum),
are also said to be the grounds of its ignorance and these are the
waking dream, the sleeping dream, the sleepy waking and sound sleep
or <i>sushupti</i>. These are the seven grounds of ignorance.
(Meaning hereby, all the three states of waking, dreaming and sound
sleep (<i>jágrat</i>, <i>swapna</i> and <i>sushupta</i>), to be the grounds
fertile with our ignorance and error).</p>

<p class='c009'>13. These are the seven-fold grounds, productive of sheer ignorance,
and which when joined with one another, become many more and mixed
ones, known under different denominations as you will hear by and by.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. At first there was the intelligent Intellect (Chaitanya Chit),
which gave rise to the nameless and pure intelligence Suddha-Chit;
which became the source of the would-be mind and living soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. This intellect remained as the ever waking embryonic seed of
all, wherefore it is called the waking seed (Vijajágrat); and as
it is the first condition of cognition, it is said to be the primal
 waking state.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. Now know the waking state to be next to the primal waking
intelligence of God, and it consists of the belief of the
individual personality, of the <i>ego</i> and <i>meity</i>,—aham and mama;
<i>i.e.</i> this am I and these are mine by chance—prág-abháva. (The
first is the knowledge of the impersonal soul, and the second
the knowledge of personal or individual souls).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. The glaring or great waking—mahajágrat, consists in
the firm belief that I am such a one, and this thing is mine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>by virtue of my merits in this or by-gone times or <i>Karman</i>.
(This positive knowledge of one’s self and his properties, is the
greatest error of the waking man).</p>

<p class='c009'>18. The cognition of the reality of any thing either by
bias—rudhádhyása or mistake—arudha, is called the waking dream;
as the sight of two moons in the halo, of silver in shells, and
water in the mirage; as also the imaginary castle building of
day dreamers.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. Dreaming in sleep is of many kinds, as known to one on his
waking, who doubts their truth owing to their short-lived duration
(as it was in the dreaming of Lavana).</p>

<p class='c009'>20. The reliance which is placed in things seen in a dream,
after one wakes from his sleep, is called his waking dream,
and lasting in its remembrance only in his mind. (Such is
the reliance in divine inspirations and prophetic dreams
which come to be fulfilled).</p>

<p class='c009'>21. A thing long unseen and appearing dimly with a stalwart
figure in the dream, if taken for a real thing of the waking
state, is called also a waking dream. (As that of Brutus
on his seeing the stalwart figure of Cæsar).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. A dream dreamt either in the whole body or dead body
of the dreamer, appears as a phantom of the waking state:
(as a living old man remembers his past youthful person,
and a departed soul viewing the body it has left behind).</p>

<p class='c009'>23. Besides these six states, there is a torpid—jada state of
the living soul, which is called his <i>sushupta</i>—hypnotism or
sound sleep, and is capable of feeling its future pleasures
and pains. (The soul retains even in this torpid state, the
self-consciousness of its merit and demerit (as impressions—<i>sanskáras</i>
in itself, and the sense of the consequent bliss or misery,
which is to attend upon it)).</p>

<p class='c009'>24. In this last state of the soul or mind, all outward objects
from a straw up to a mountain, appear as mere atoms of dust in
its presence; as the mind views the miniature of the world in
profound meditation.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>25. I have thus told you Ráma, the features of true knowledge
and error in brief, but each of these states branches out into
a hundred forms, with various traits of their own.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. A long continued waking dream is accounted as the waking
state—<i>jágrat</i>, and it becomes diversified according to the
diversity of its objects. (<i>i.e.</i> Waking is but a continued
dreaming).</p>

<p class='c009'>27. The waking state contains under it the conditions of
the wakeful soul of God; also there are many things under
these conditions which mislead men from one error to another;
as a storm casts the boats into whirlpools and eddies.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. Some of the lengthened dreams in sleep, appear as the
waking sight of day light; while others though seen in the
broad day-light of the waking state, are no better than
night-dreams seen in the day time, and are thence called
our day dreams.</p>

<p class='c009'>29. I have thus far related to you the seven grades of the
grounds of ignorance, which with all their varieties, are
to be carefully avoided by the right use of our reason,
and by the sight of the Supreme soul in our-selves.</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. Definitions of the seven Grounds of Knowledge, together
with that of Adepts—<i>árúdhasin</i> in Yoga, and also of Liberation.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> continued:—O sinless Ráma, attend now to the
sevenfold stages of cognoscence, by the knowledge of
which you will no more plunge into the mire of ignorance.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Disputants are apt to hold out many more stages of Yoga
meditation; but in my opinion these (septuple stages) are
sufficient for the attainment of the chief good on ultimate
liberation. (The disputants are the Patánjala Yoga philosophers,
who maintain various modes of discipline, for attaining to
particular perfections of consummation—Siddhi; but the main
object of this Sástra is the <i>summum bonum</i> (parama-purushártha)
which is obtainable by means of the seven stages—Bhúmikas
which are expounded herein below).</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Knowledge is understanding, which consists in knowing
these seven stages only; but liberation—mukti, which is the
object of knowledge (jnána), transcends the acquaintance of
these septuple stages.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Knowledge of truth is liberation (moksha), and all these
three are used as synonymous terms; because the living being
that has known the truth, is freed from transmigration as by
his liberation also. (The three words <i>mukti</i>, <i>moksha</i> and
<i>jnána</i> imply the same thing).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. The grounds of knowledge comprise the desire of becoming
good—subhechhá, and this good will is the first step. Then
comes discretion or reasoning (vicháraná) the second, followed
by purity of mind (tanu-manasa), which is the third grade to
the gaining of knowledge.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. The fourth is self-reliance  as the true refuge—Sattá-patti,
then <i>asansakti</i> or worldly apathy as the fifth. The sixth is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span><i>padárthabháva</i> or the power of abstraction, and the seventh or
the last stage of knowledge is <i>turya-gati</i> or generalization of
all in one.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Liberation is placed at the end of these, and is attained
without difficulty after them. Attend now to the definitions
of these steps as I shall explain them unto you.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. First of all is the desire of goodness, springing from
dispassionateness to worldly matters, and consisting in the
thought, “why do I sit idle, I must know the Sástras in the
company of good men.”</p>

<p class='c009'>9. The second is discretion, which arises from association
with wise and good men, study of the Sástras, habitual aversion
to worldliness, and consists in an inclination to good conduct,
and the doing of all sorts of good acts.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. The third is the subduing of the mind, and restraining
it from sensual enjoyments; and these are produced by the two
former qualities of good will and discretion.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. The fourth is self-reliance, and dependence upon the
Divine spirit as the true refuge of this soul. This is
attainable by means of the three qualities described above.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. The fifth is worldly apathy, as it is shown by one’s
detachment from all earthly concerns and society of men, by
means of the former quadruple internal delight (which comes
from above).</p>

<p class='c009'>13. By practice of the said fivefold virtues, as also by the
feeling of self-satisfaction and inward delight (spiritual joy);
man is freed from his thoughts and cares, about all internal and
external objects.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. Then comes the powers of cogitation into the abstract
meanings of things, as the sixth step to the attainment of
true knowledge. It is fostered either by one’s own exertion,
or guidance of others in search of truth.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. Continued habitude of these six qualifications and incognition
of differences in religion, and the reducing of them all to the
knowledge of one true God of nature, is called generalization.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>(Because all things in general, proceed from the one and are
finally reduced in to the same).</p>

<p class='c009'>16. This universal generalization appertains to the nature
of the living liberation of the man, who beholds all things
in one and in the same light. Above this is the state of that
glorious light, which is arrived by the disembodied soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. Those fortunate men, O Ráma, who have arrived to the
seventh stage of their knowledge, are those great minds that
delight in the light of their souls, and have reached to their
highest state of humanity.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. The living liberated are not plunged in the waters of
pleasure and sorrow, but remain sedate and unmoved in both
states; they are at liberty either to do or slight to discharge
the duties of their conditions and positions in society.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. These men being roused from their deep meditation by
intruders, betake themselves to their secular duties, like
men awakened from their slumber (at their own option).</p>

<p class='c009'>20. Being ravished by the inward delight of their souls, they
feel no pleasure in the delights of the world; just as men
immerged in sound sleep, can feel no delight at the dalliance
of beauties about them.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. These seven stages of knowledge are known only to the
wise and thinking men, and not to beasts and brutes and
immoveable things all around us. They are unknown to the
barbarians and those that are barbarous in their minds
and dispositions.</p>

<p class='c009'>22. But any one that has attained to these states of knowledge,
whether it be a beast or barbarian, an embodied being or
disembodied spirit, has undoubtedly obtained its liberation.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. Knowledge severs the bonds of ignorance, and by loosening
them, produces the liberation of our souls: it is the sole
cause of removing the fallacy of the appearance of water in
the mirage, and the like errors.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. Those who being freed from ignorance, have not arrived
at their ultimate perfection of disembodied liberation; have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>yet secured the salvation of their souls, by being placed in
these stages of knowledge in their embodied state during their
life time.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. Some have passed all these stages, and others over two or
three of them; some have passed the six grades, while a few
have attained to their seventh state all at once (as the sages
Sanaka, Nárada and other holy saints have done from their very
birth).</p>

<p class='c009'>26. Some have gone over three stages, and others have attained
the last; some have passed four stages, and some no more than
one or two of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. There are some that have advanced only a quarter or
half or three fourths of a stage. Some have passed over
four quarters and a half, and some six and a half.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. Common people walking upon this earth, know nothing
regarding these passengers in the paths of knowledge; but
remain as blind as their eyes were dazzled by some planetary
light or eclipsed by its shadow.</p>

<p class='c009'>29. Those wise men are compared to victorious kings, who
stand victorious on these seven grounds of knowledge. The
celestial elephants are nothing before them; and mighty
warriors must bend their heads before them.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. Those great minds that are victors on these grounds of
knowledge, are worthy of veneration, as they are conquerors of
their enemies of their hearts and senses; and they are entitled
to a station above that of an emperor and an autocrat, samrat
and virat, both in this world and in the next in their embodied
and disembodied liberations—<i>sadeha</i> and <i>videha muktis</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class="smcap">Notes</span>:—These terms called the grades of knowledge may be better
understood in their appropriate English expressions, as:—</p>

<p class='c009'>1. Desire of improvement.</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. Ascertaining the True Unity by rejecting the
illusory forms and on the said Grounds of Knowledge.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> said:—The human soul reflecting on its <i>egoism</i>,
forgets its essence of the Supreme soul; as the gold-ring
thinking on its formal rotundity, loses its thought of the
substantial gold whereof it is made.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Ráma said:—Please tell me sir, how the gold can have
its consciousness of its form of the ring, as the soul
is conscious of its transformation to egoism.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Vasishtha said:—The questions of sensible men, relate only
to the substances of things, and not to the production and
dissolution of the existent formal parts of things, and neither
to those of the non-existent; so you should ask of the substances
of the soul and gold, and not of the ego and the ring, which
are unsubstantial nullities in nature. (So men appraise the
value of the gold of which the ring is made, and not by the
form of the ring).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. When the jeweller sells his gold-ring for the price of
gold, he undoubtedly delivers the gold which is the substance
of the ring and not the ring without its substance. (So the
shapes of things are nothing at all, but the essential
substance—Brahma underlying all things, is all in all).</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Ráma asked:—If such is the case that you take the gold
for the ring, then what becomes of the ring as we commonly
take it to be? Explain this to me, that I may thereby know
the substance of Brahma (underlying all appearances).</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Vasishtha said:—All form, O Ráma, is formless and accidental
quality, and no essential property of things. So if you would
ascertain the nature of a nullity, then tell me the shape and
qualities of a barren woman’s son (which are null and nothing).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>7. Do not fall into the error of taking the circularity of the
ring, as an essential property of it; the form of a thing is only
apparent and not prominent to the sight. (In European philosophy,
form is defined as the essence of a thing, for without it nothing
is conceivable. But matter being the recipient of form, it does
form any part of its essence. Vasishtha speaking of matter as void
of form, means the <i>materia prima</i> of Aristotle, or the elementary
sorts of it).</p>

<p class='c009'>8. The water in the mirage, the two moons in the sky, the egoism
of men and the forms of things, though appearing as real ones to
sight and thought, cannot be proved as separate existences apart
from their subjects. (All these therefore are fallacies vanishing
before <i>vichárana</i> or reasoning, the second ground of true knowledge).</p>

<p class='c009'>9. Again the likeness of silver that appears in pearl-shells,
can not be realized in the substance of the pearl-mother,
or even a particle of it at any time or any place. (The Sanskrit
alliterations of <i>kanam</i>, <i>kshanam</i>, <i>kvanu</i>, cannot be preserved
in translation).</p>

<p class='c009'>10. It is the incircumspect view of a thing that makes a
nullity appear as a reality, as the appearance of silver in the
shell and the water in the mirage (all which are but deceptions
of sight and other senses, and are therefore never trustworthy).</p>

<p class='c009'>11. The nullity of a <i>nil</i> appears as an <i>ens</i> to sight, as also
the fallacy of a thing as something where there is nothing
of the kind (as of silver in the pearl-mother and water
in the mirage).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. Sometimes an unreal shadow acts the part of a real substance,
as the false apprehension of a ghost kills a lad with the fear of
being killed by it. (Fright of goblins and bogies of mormos and
ogres, have killed many men in the dark).</p>

<p class='c009'>13. There remains nothing in the gold-jewel except gold, after
its form of jewellery is destroyed; therefore the forms of the
ring and bracelet are no more, than drops of oil or water on a
heap of sand. The forms are absorbed in the substance, as the
fluids in dust or sand.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>14. There is nothing real or unreal on earth, except the false
creations of our brain (as appearances in our dreams); and these
whether known as real or unreal, are equally productive of their
consequences, as the sights and fears of spectres in children.
(We are equally encouraged by actual rewards and flattering hopes,
as we are depressed at real degradation and its threatening fear).</p>

<p class='c009'>15. A thing whether it is so or not, proves yet as such as it is
believed to be, by different kinds and minds of men; as poison
becomes as effective as elixir to the sick, and ambrosia proves
as heinous as hemlock with the intemperate. (So is false faith
thought to be as efficacious by the vulgar as the true belief
of the wise).</p>

<p class='c009'>16. Belief in the only essence of the soul, constitutes true
knowledge, and not in its likeness of the ego and mind, as it
is generally believed in this world. Therefore abandon the
thought of your false and unfounded egoism or individual
existence. (This is said to be self-reliance or dependance
on the universal soul of God).</p>

<p class='c009'>17. As there is no rotundity of the ring inherent in gold; so
there is no individuality of <i>egoism</i> in the all-pervading
universal soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. There is nothing everlasting beside Brahma, and no
personality of Him as a Brahmá, Vishnu or any other. There
is no substantive existence as the world, but off spring of
Brahmá called the patriarchs. (All these are said to be
negative terms in many passages of the srutis as the following:—</p>

<p class='c009'>There is no substantiality except that of Brahma. There is
no personality (ádesa) of him. He is Brahma the supreme soul
and no other. He is neither the outward nor inward nor he is
nothing.)</p>

<p class='c009'>19. There are no other worlds beside Brahma, nor is the
heaven without Him. The hills, the demons, the mind and
body all rest in that spirit which is no one of these.</p>

<p class='c009'>20. He is no elementary principle, nor is he any cause as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>the material or efficient. He is none of the three times of
past, present and future but all; nor is he anything in being
or not-being (<i>in esse</i> or <i>posse</i> or in <i>nubibus</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>21. He is beyond your <i>egoism</i> or <i>tuism</i>, <i>ipseism</i> and <i>suism</i>,
and all your entities and non-entities. There is no attribution
nor particularity in Him, who is above all your ideas, and
is none of the ideal personifications of your notions (<i>i.e.</i> He
is none of the mythic persons of abstract ideas as Love and
the like).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. He is the <i>plenum</i> of the world, supporting and moving
all, being unmoved and unsupported by any. He is everlasting
and undecaying bliss; having no name or symbol or cause
of his own. (He is the being that pervades through and
presides over all—<i>sanmátram</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>23. He is no <i>sat</i> or <i>est</i> or a being that is born and existent,
nor an <i>asat</i>—<i>nonest</i> (<i>i.e.</i> extinct); he is neither the beginning,
middle or end of anything, but is all in all. He is unthinkable
in the mind, and unutterable by speech. He is vacuum about
the vacuity, and a bliss above all felicity.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. Ráma said:—I understand now Brahma to be self-same in all
things, yet I want to know what is this creation, that we see
all about us. (<i>i.e.</i> Are they the same with Brahma or distinct
from him?)</p>

<p class='c009'>25. Vasishtha replied: The supreme spirit being perfectly
tranquil, and all things being situated in Him, it is wrong to
speak of this creation or that, when there is no such thing as
a creation at any time.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. All things exist in the all containing spirit of God, as
the whole body of water is contained in the universal ocean;
but there is fluctuation in the waters owing to their fluidity,
whereas there is no motion in the quiet and motionless spirit
of God.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. The light of the luminaries shines of itself, but not so
the Divine light; it is the nature of all lights to shine of
themselves, but the light of Brahma is not visible to sight.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>28. As the waves of the ocean rise and fall in the body of
its waters, so do these phenomena appear as the noumena in
the mind of God (as his ever-varying thoughts).</p>

<p class='c009'>29. To men of little understandings, these thoughts of the
Divine mind appear as realities; and they think this sort of
ideal creation, will be lasting for ages.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. Creation is ascertained to be a cognition (a thought) of
the Divine Mind; it is not a thing different from the mind
of God, as the visible sky is no other than a part of Infinity.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. The production and extinction of the world, are mere
thoughts of the Divine mind; as the formation and dissolution
of ornaments take place in the self-same substance of gold.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. The mind that has obtained its calm composure, views the
creation as full with the presence of God; but those that are
led by their own convictions, take the inexistent for reality,
as children believe the ghosts as real existences.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. The consciousness of ego (or the subjective self-existence), is
the cause of the error of the objective knowledge of creation; but
the tranquil unconsciousness of ourselves, brings us to the knowledge
of the supreme, who is above the objective and inert creation.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. These different created things appear in a different light
to the sapient, who views them all in the unity of God, as the
toy puppets of a militia, are well known to the intelligent to
be made and composed of mud and clay.</p>

<p class='c009'>35. This plenitude of the world is without its beginning and end,
and appears as a faultless or perfect peace of workmanship. It is
full with the fullness of the supreme Being, and remains full in
the fullness of God.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. This plenum which appears as the created world, is
essentially the Great Brahma, and situated in his greatness;
just as the sky is situated in the sky, tranquility in tranquility,
and felicity in felicity. (These are absolute and identic terms,
as the whole is the whole &amp;c.).</p>

<p class='c009'>37. Look at the reflexion of a longsome landscape in a mirror,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span> and the picture of a far stretching city in the miniature;
and you will find the distances of the objects lost in their
closeness. So the distances of worlds are lost in their
propinquity to one another in the spirit of God.</p>

<p class='c009'>38. The world is thought as a nonentity by some, and as an
entity by others; by their taking it in the different lights
of its being a thing beside God, and its being but a reflection
of Brahma. (In the former case it is a nonentity as there can
be nothing without God; in the latter sense it is real entity
being identic with God).</p>

<p class='c009'>39. After all, it can have no real entity, being like the picture
of a city and not as the city itself. It is as false as the
appearance of limpid water in the desert mirage, and that of the
double moon in the sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>40. As it is the practice of magicians, to show magic cities
in the air, by sprinkling handfuls of dust before our eyes;
so doth our erroneous consciousness represent the unreal world,
as a reality unto us.</p>

<p class='c009'>41. Unless our inborn ignorance (error) like an arbour of
noxious plants, is burnt down to the very root by the flame of
right reasoning, it will not cease to spread out its branches,
and grow the rankest weeds of our imaginary pleasures and sorrows.</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. Lavana goes to the Vindhyan region, and
sees his consort and relatives of the dreaming state.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> continued:—Now Ráma, attend to the wonderful
power of the said Avidyá or error, in displaying the
changeful phenomenals, like the changing forms of
ornaments in the substance of the self-same gold.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. The king Lavana, having at the end of his dream, perceived
the falsehood of his vision, resolved on the following day to
visit that great forest himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. He said to himself: Ah! when shall I revisit the
Vindhyan region, which is inscribed in my mind; and
where I remember to have undergone a great many hardships
in my forester’s life.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. So saying, he took to his southward journey, accompanied
by his ministers and attendants, as if he was going to make
a conquest of that quarter, where he arrived at the foot of
the mount in a few days.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. There he wandered about the southern, and eastern and
western shores of the sea (<i>i.e.</i> all round the Eastern
and Western Ghats). He was as delighted with his curvilinear
course, as the luminary of the day, in his diurnal journey
from east to west.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. He saw there in a certain region, a deep and doleful forest
stretching wide along his path, and likening the dark and dismal
realms of death (Yama or Pluto).</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Roving in this region he beheld everything, he had seen before
in his dream; he then inquired into the former circumstances, and
wondered to learn their conformity with the occurrences of his vision.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>8. He recognised there the Chandála hunters of his dream, and
being curious to know the rest of the events, he continued in
his peregrination about the forest.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. He then beheld a hamlet at the skirt of the wilderness,
foggy with smoke, and appearing as the spot where he bore
the name of Pushta Pukkasa or fostered Chandála.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. He beheld there the same huts and hovels, and the
various kinds of human habitations, fields and plains,
with the same men and women that dwelt their before.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. He beheld the same landscapes and leafless branches of
trees, shorn of their foliage by the all devouring famine;
he saw the same hunters pursuing their chase, and the same
helpless orphans lying thereabouts.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. He saw the old lady (his mother-in-law), wailing at the
misfortunes of other matrons; who were lamenting like herself
with their eyes suffused in tears, at the untimely deaths and
innumerable miseries of their fellow brethren.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. The old matrons with their eyes flowing with brilliant
drops of tears, and with their bodies and bosoms emaciated
under the pressure of their afflictions; were mourning with
loud acclamations of woe in that dreary district, stricken
by drought and dearth.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. They cried, O ye sons and daughters, that lie dead with
your emaciated bodies for want of food for these three days;
say where fled your dear lives, stricken as they were by the
steel of famine from the armour of your bodies.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. We remember your sweet smiles, showing your coral
teeth resembling the red gunjaphalas to our lords, as
they descended from the towering <i>tála</i> (palm trees),
with their red-ripe fruits held by their teeth, and
growing on the cloud-capt mountains.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. When shall we see again the fierce leap of our boys,
springing on the wolves crouching amidst the groves of
Kadamba and Jamb and Lavanga and Gunja trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. We do not see those graces even in the face of Káma
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>the god of love, that we were wont to observe in the blue and
black countenances of our children, resembling the dark hue of
Tamála leaves, when feasting on their dainty food of fish and
flesh.</p>
<p class="center p2">Lamentation of the mother-in-law.</p>
<p class='c009'>18. My nigrescent daughter, says one, has been snatched
away from me with my dear husband like the dark Yamuná by
the fierce Yama. O they have been carried away from me
like the <i>Tamála</i> branch with its clustering flowers,
by a tremendous gale from this sylvan scene.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. O my daughter, with thy necklace of the strings of red
<i>gunja</i> seeds, gracing the protuberant breast of thy youthful
person; and with thy swarthy complexion, seeming as the sea
of ink was gently shaken by the breeze. Ah! whither hast thou
fled with thy raiment of woven withered leaves, and thy teeth
as black as the jet-jambu fruits (when fully ripe).</p>

<p class='c009'>20. O young prince! that wast as fair as the full moon, and
that didst forsake the fairies of thy harem, and didst take
so much delight in my daughter, where hast thou fled from us?
Ah my daughter! she too is dead in thy absence, and fled from
my presence.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. Being cast on the waves of this earthly ocean, and joined
to the daughter of a Chandála, thou wast, O prince! subjected to
mean and vile employments, that disgraced thy princely character.
(This is a taunt to all human beings that disgrace their
heavenly nature, and grovel as beasts while living on earth).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. Ah! that daughter of mine with her tremulous eyes, like
those of the timorous fawn, and Oh! that husband valiant as
the royal tiger; you are both gone together, as the high hopes
and great efforts of men are fled with the loss of their wealth.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. Now grown husbandless, and having of late lost my
daughter also, and being thrown in a distant and barren land,
I am become the most miserable and wretched of beings. Born
of a low caste, I am cast out of all prospect in life, and
have become a personification of terror to myself, and a
sight of horror to others.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>24. O! that the Lord has made me a widowed woman, and
subjected me to the insult of the vulgar, and the hauteur of
the affluent. Prostrated by hunger and mourning at the loss
of a husband and child, I rove incessantly from door to door
to beg alms for my supportance (as it is the case of most
female beggars).</p>

<p class='c009'>25. It is better that one who is unfortunate and friendless, or
subject to passion and diseases, should rather die sooner than
live in misery. The dead and inanimate beings are far better
than the living miserable.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. Those that are friendless, and have to toil and moil in
unfriendly places, are like the grass of the earth, trampled
under the feet, and overwhelmed under a flood of calamities.</p>

<p class='c009'>27. The king seeing his aged mother-in-law mourning in this
manner, offered her some consolation through the medium of
her female companions, and then asked that lady to tell him,
“who she was, what she did there, who was her daughter and
who is his son.”</p>

<p class='c009'>28. She answered him with tears in her eyes:—This village
is called Pukkasa-Ghosha, here I had a Pukkasa for my husband,
who had a daughter as gentle as the moon.</p>

<p class='c009'>29. She happened to have here a husband as beautiful as the
moon, who was a king and chanced to pass by this way. By
this accident they were matched together, in the manner that an
ass finds by chance a pot of honey lying on her way in the forest.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. She lived long with him in connubial bliss, and produced
to him both sons and daughters, who grew up in the covert of
this forest, as the gourd plant grows on a tree serving as its
support.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> Chandála continued:—O lord of men! After lapse of sometime,
there occurred a dearth in this place owing to the drought of
rain, which broke down all men under its diresome pressure.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Pressed by extreme scarcity, all our village people were
scattered far abroad, and they perished in famine and never
returned.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Thence forward O lord! we are exposed to utmost misery, and
sit lamenting here in our helpless poverty. Behold us lord, all
bathed in tears falling profusely from our undrying eyelids.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. The King was lost in wonder, at hearing these words from
the mouth of the elderly lady; and looking at the face of his
follower the faithful minister, remained in dumb amazement
as the figure in a picture.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. He reflected repeatedly on this strange occurrence, and
its curious concurrence with his adventures in the dream. He
made repeated queries relating to other circumstances, and the
more he heard and learned of them, the more he found their
coincidence with the occurrences of his vision.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. He sympathised with their woes, and saw them in the same state,
as he had seen them before in his dream. And then he gave suitable
gifts and presents to relieve their wants and woes.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. He tarried there a long while, and pondered on the
decrees of destiny; when the wheel of fortune brought him
back to his house, wherein he entered amidst the loud cheers
and low salutations of the citizens.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. In the morning the King appeared in his court hall, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>sitting there amidst his courtiers, asked me saying:—“How
is it, O sage, that my dream has come to be verified in my
presence to each item and to my great surprise”?</p>

<p class='c009'>9. “They answered me exactly and to the very point all what
I asked of them, and have removed my doubt of their truth
from the mind, as the winds disperse the clouds of heaven.”</p>

<p class='c009'>10. Know thus, O Ráma! it is the illusion of Avidya, that
is the cause of a great many errors, by making the untruth
appear as truth, and representing the sober reality as
unreality.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. Ráma said: Tell me sir, how the dream came to be
verified; it is a mysterious account that cannot find
a place in my heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. Vasishtha replied:—All this is possible, O Ráma! to the
illusion of ignorance (Avidya); which shows the fallacy of
a picture (pata) in a pot (ghata); and represents the actual
occurrences of life as dreams, and dreams as realities.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. Distance appears to be nigh, as a distant mountain seen
in the mirror; and a long time seems a short interval, as a
night of undisturbed repose.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. What is untrue seems to be a truth as in dreaming one’s
own death in sleep; and that which is impossible appears
possible, as in one’s aerial journey in a dream.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. The stable seems unsteady, as in the erroneous notion of
the motion of fixed objects to one passing in a vehicle; and
the unmoving seem to be moving to one, as under the influence
of his inebriation.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. The mind infatuated by one’s hobby, sees exposed to its
view, all what it thinks upon within itself. It sees things in
the same light, as they are painted in his fancy, whether they
be in existence or not, or real or unreal.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. No sooner does the mind contract its ignorance, by its
false notions of egoism and tuism, than it is subjected to
endless errors, which have no beginning, middle or end and
are of incessant occurrence in their course.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>18. It is the notion that gives a shape to all things; it
makes a kalpa age appear as a moment, and also prolongs a
moment of time to a whole Kalpa.</p>

<p class='c009'>19. A man deprived of understanding, believes himself as he is
said, to have become a sheep; so a fighting ram thinks himself
to be a lion in his ideal bravery. (The word sheep is a term
of derision, as the lion is that of applause).</p>

<p class='c009'>20. Ignorance causes the blunder of taking things for what
they are not, and falling into the errors of egoism and tuism:
so all errors in the mind produce errors in actions also.</p>

<p class='c009'>21. It is by mere accident, that men come in possession of
the objects of their desire; and it is custom that determines
the mode of mutual dealings. (The gain is accidental and the
dealing is conventional).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. Lavana’s remembrance of the dream of his having lived
in the habitation of the Pukkasa, was the internal cause, that
represented to him the external picture of that abode, as it was
a reality. (The mind shows what we think upon, whether they
are real or unreal ones).</p>

<p class='c009'>23. As the human mind is liable to forget many things which
are actually done by some, so it is susceptible to remember those
acts as true which were never done, but had been merely thought
upon in the mind. (The forgetfulness of actualities as well as
the thoughts of inactualities, belong both to the province of the
mind. Here Lavana did not remember what he had not done, but
recollected the thoughts that passed in his mind).</p>

<p class='c009'>24. In this manner is the thought of my having eaten something
while I am really fasting; and that of my having sojourned in
a distant country in a dream, appears true to me while I think
of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. It was thence that the king came to find the same conduct
in the habitation of the Chandálas at the side of Vindhyá, as he
had been impressed with its notion in his dream as said before.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. Again the false dream that Lavana had dreamt of the
Vindhyan people, the same took possession of their minds also.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>(The same thought striking in the minds of different persons
at the same time (as we see in men of the same mind)).</p>

<p class='c009'>27. The notion of Lavana as settled in the minds of the
Vindhyans, as the thoughts of these people rose in the mind
of the king. (If it is possible for us to transfer our thoughts
to one another, how much easier must it be for the superior
instrumentality of dreams and revelations to do the same also.
This is the yoga, whereby one man reads the mind of another).
Again the same error taking possession of many minds all at
once, proves the futility of common sense and universal belief
being taken for certainty, hence the common belief of the reality
of things, is the effect of universal delusion and error.</p>

<p class='c009'>28. As the same sentiments and figures of speech, occur in
different poets of distant ages and countries, so it is not striking
that the same thoughts and ideas should rise simultaneously in the
minds of different men also. (We have a striking instance of the
coincidence of the same thought in the titles of Venisanhára
and Rape of the Lock, in the minds of Vhattanarayn and Pope).</p>

<p class='c009'>29. In common experience, we find the notions and ideas
to stand for the things themselves, otherwise nothing is known
to exist at all without our notion or idea of it in the mind.
(All that we know of, are our ideas and nothing besides. Locke
and Berkeley).</p>

<p class='c009'>30. One idea embraces many others also under it, as those of
the waves and current, are contained under that of water. And
so one thought is associated by others relating its past, present
and future conditions of being; as the thought of a seed accompanies
the thoughts of its past and future states and its fruits and
flowers of the tree. (So the word man, comprises almost every
idea relating to humanity).</p>

<p class='c009'>31. Nothing has its entity or non-entity, nor can anything be
said to exist or not to be, unless we have a positive idea of
the existent, and a negative notion of the in-existent.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. All that we see in our error, is as inexistent as oiliness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>in sands; and so the bracelet is nothing in reality, but a
formal appearance of the substance of gold.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. A fallacy can have no connection with the reality, as
the fallacy of the world with the reality of God, and so the
fallacy of the ring with the substance of gold and of the serpent
with the rope. The connection or mutual relation of things of
the same kind, is quite evident in our minds.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. The relation of gum resin and the tree, is one of dissimilar
union, and affords no distinct ideas of them except that of the
tree which contains the other. (So the idea of the false world,
is lost in that of its main <i>substratum</i> of the Divine Spirit).</p>

<p class='c009'>35. As all things are full of the Spirit, so we have distinct
ideas of them in our minds, which are also spiritual substances;
and are not as dull material stones which have no feelings.<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c010'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>36. Because all things in the world are intellectually true and
real, we have therefore their ideas impressed in our minds also.</p>

<p class='c009'>37. There can not be a relation or connection of two dissimilar
things, which may be lasting, but are never united together. For
without such mutual relation of things, no idea of both can be
formed together.</p>

<p class='c009'>38. Similar things being joined with similar form together their
wholes of the same kind, presenting one form and differing in nothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>39. The intellect being joined with an abstract idea, produces
an invisible, inward and uniform thought: so dull matter joined
to another dull object, forms a denser material object to view.
But the intellectual and material can never unite together
owing to their different natures.</p>

<p class='c009'>40. The intellectual and material parts of a person, can never
be drawn together in any picture; because the intellectual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>part having the intellect, has the power of knowledge,
which is wanting in the material picture.</p>

<p class='c009'>41. Intellectual beings do not take into account the difference
of material things as wood and stone; which combine together
for some useful purpose (as the building of a house and the like).</p>

<p class='c009'>42. The relation between the tongue and taste is also homogeneous;
because <i>rasa</i> taste and <i>rasand</i> the instrument of tasting,
are both watery substances, and there is no heterogeneous
relation between them. (And so of the other organs of sense
and their respective objects).</p>

<p class='c009'>43. But there is no relation between intellect and matter; as
there is between the stone and the wood; the intellect cannot
combine with wood and stone to form anything. (The mind and
matter have no relation with one another, nor can they unite
together in any way).</p>

<p class='c009'>44. Spiritually considered, all things are alike, because they
are full with the same spirit; otherwise the error of distinction
between the viewer and the view, creates endless differences as
betwixt wood and stones and other things.</p>

<p class='c009'>45. The relation of combination though unseen in spirits,
yet it is easily conceived that spirits can assume any form <i>ad
libitum</i> and <i>ad infinitum</i> (but they must be spiritual and never
material. So also a material thing can be converted to another
material object, but never to a spiritual form).</p>

<p class='c009'>46. Know ye seekers of truth, all things to be identic with
the entity of God. Renounce your knowledge of nonentities and
the various kinds of errors and fallacies and know the One as
All <i>to pan</i>. (The omnipotent spirit of God, is joined with
all material things, in its spiritual form only; and it is
knowable to the mind and spirit of man, and never by their
material organs of sense).</p>

<p class='c009'>47. The Intellect being full with its knowledge, there is nothing
wanting to us; it presents us everything in its circumference,
as the imagination having its wide range, shews us the sights
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>of its air-built castles and every thing beside. (The difference
consists in the intellect’s shewing us the natures of things
in their true light, and the imagination’s portraying them in
false shapes and colours to our minds).</p>

<p class='c009'>48. To Him there is no limit of time or place, but his presence
extends over all his creation. It is ignorance that separates
the creator from creation, and raises the errors of egoism
and tuism (<i>i.e.</i> of the subjective and objective. The union
of these into One is the ground-work of pantheism).</p>

<p class='c009'>49. Leaving the knowledge of the substantive gold, man contracts
the error of taking it for the formal ornament. The mistake of
the jewel for gold, is as taking one thing for another, and the
production for the producer.</p>

<p class='c009'>50. The error of the phenomenon vanishes upon loss of the
eyesight, and the difference of the jewel (or visible shape),
is lost in the substance of gold.</p>

<p class='c009'>51. The knowledge of unity removes that of a distinct creation,
as the knowledge of the clay takes off the sense of puppet
soldiers made of it. (So the detection of Æsop’s ass in the
lion’s skin, and that of the daw with the peacock’s feathers,
removed the false appearance of their exteriors).</p>

<p class='c009'>52. The same Brahma causes the error of the reality of the
exterior worlds, as the underlying sea causes the error of the
waves on its surface. The same wood is mistaken for the carved
figure, and the common clay is taken for the pot which is made
of it. (The truth is that, which underlies the appearance).</p>

<p class='c009'>53. Between the sight and its object, there lieth the eye
of the beholder, which is beyond the sight of its viewer,
and is neither the view nor the viewer. (Such is the supreme
Being hidden alike from the view and the viewer).</p>

<p class='c009'>54. The mind traversing from one place to another, leaves the
body in the interim, which is neither moving nor quite unmoved;
since its mental part only is in its moving state. (So should
you remain sedate with your body, but be ever active in your mind).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>55. Remain always in that quiet state, which is neither one of
waking, dreaming nor of sleeping; and which is neither the state
of sensibility or insensibility; but one of everlasting tranquility
and rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>56. Drive your dullness, and remain always in the company of
your sound intellect as a solid rock; and whether in joy or
grief, commit your soul to your Maker.</p>

<p class='c009'>57. There is nothing which one has to lose or earn in this
world; therefore remain in uniform joy and bliss, whether you
think yourself to be blest or unblest in life. (“Naked came I,
and naked must I return; blessed be the name of the Lord”).</p>

<p class='c009'>58. The soul residing in thy body, neither loves nor hates
aught at any time; therefore rest in quiet, and fear naught
for what betides thy body, and engage not thy mind to the
actions of thy body.</p>

<p class='c009'>59. Remain free from anxiety about the present, as you are
unconcerned about the future. Never be impelled by the impulses
of your mind; but remain steadfast in your trust in the true God.</p>

<p class='c009'>60. Be unconcerned with all, and remain as an absent man. Let
thy heart remain callous to everything like a block of stone
or toy of wood; and look upon your mind as an inanimate thing,
by the spiritual light of your soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>61. As there is no water in the stone nor fire in water, so
the spiritual man has no mental action, nor the Divine spirit
hath any. (There is no mutability of mental actions in the
immutable mind of God).</p>

<p class='c009'>62. If that which is unseen, should ever come to do anything
or any action; that action is not attributed to the unseen
agent, but to something else in the mind. (But the mind
being ignored, its actions are ignored also).</p>

<p class='c009'>63. The unselfpossessed (unspiritual) man, that follows the
dictates of his fickle and wilful mind, resembles a man of the
border land, following the customs of the out-cast Mlechchás or
barbarians.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>64. Having disregarded the dictates of your vile mind, you
may remain at ease and as fearless, as an insensible statue
made of clay.</p>

<p class='c009'>65. He who understands that there is no such thing as the
mind, or that he had one before but it is dead in him to-day;
becomes as immovable as a marble statue with this assurance
in himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>66. There being no appearance of the mind in any wise, and
you having no such thing in you in reality except your soul;
say, why do you in vain infer its existence for your own error
and harm?</p>

<p class='c009'>67. Those who vainly subject themselves to the false apparition
of the mind, are mostly men of unsound understandings, and bring
fulminations on themselves from the full-moon of the pure soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>68. Remain firm as thou art with thyself (soul), by casting
afar thy fancied and fanciful mind from thee; and be freed
from the thoughts of the world, by being settled in the thought
of the Supreme Soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>69. They who follow a nullity as the unreal mind, are like those
fools who shoot at the inane air, and are cast into the shade.</p>

<p class='c009'>70. He that has purged off his mind, is indeed a man of great
understanding; he has gone across the error of the existence
of the world, and become purified in his soul. We have considered
long, and never found anything as the impure mind in the pure soul.</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
Argument. Description of the grounds of knowledge, vanity of
fears and sorrows, and the natures of the intellect and soul.
</div>

<p class='c009 noindent'><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">V</span>asishtha</span> said (Prose). After the birth of a man and
a slight development of his understanding, he should
associate the company of good and wise men.
</p>

<p class='c009'>2. There is no other way except by the light of Sástras and
association with the good and wise, to ford over the river of
ignorance, which runs in its incessant course flowing in a
thousand streams.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. It is by means of reasoning that man is enabled to discern
what is good for him, and what he must avoid to do.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. He then arrives to that ground of reason which is known as
good will, or a desire to do what is good and keep from what
is bad and evil.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Then he is led by his reason to the power of reasoning, and
discerning the truth from untruth, and the right from wrong.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. As he improves in knowledge, he gets rid of his improper
desires, and purifies his mind from all worldly cares.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Then he is said to have gained that stage of knowledge,
which is called the purity of his soul and mind and of his
heart and conduct.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. When the <i>yogi</i> or adept attains to his full knowledge,
he is said to have arrived at his state of goodness—satva.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. By this means and the curtailing of his desires, he arrives
to the state called unattachment or indifference to all worldly
matters (anásakta), and is no more subjected to the consequence
of his actions.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. From the curtailment of desires, the <i>yogi</i> learns
to abstract his mind from the unrealities of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>11. And whether sitting inactive in his posture of <i>Samádhi</i>
meditation, or doing anything for himself or others, he must
fix his mind to whatever is productive of real good to the world.
His soul being cool by the tenuity of his desires, is habituated
to do its duties, without the knowledge of what it is doing.
(He neither fondly pursues anything nor thinks with ardour of
any. His want of desire makes him indifferent to all, and like
a man waking from his sleep, he takes himself to the discharge
of his duties).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. Verily, he who has subdued his mind, has reached
to the contemplative stage of <i>yoga</i> meditation.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. Thus one having his mind dead in himself, learns by practice
of years, to perform his duties, by refraining from his thoughts
of external objects. Such a one is said to have attained the
<i>turya</i> or fourth stage of his spiritual elevation, and to
have become liberated in his life-time.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. He is not glad to get anything, nor sorry to miss it. He
lives without fear of accidents, and is content with whatever
he gets.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. Thou hast O Ráma! known whatever is to be known by man;
and thou hast certainly extirpated thy desire in all thy
actions through life.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. Thy thoughts are all spiritual, and transcend the actions
of the corporeal body, though thou art in thy embodied state.
Do not give up thy self to joy or grief, but know thyself to
be free from decay and defect.</p>

<p class='c009'>17. Spiritually thou art a pure and bright substance, which is
ubiquious and ever in its ascendancy. It is devoid of pleasure
and pain, and of death and disease.</p>

<p class='c009'>18. Why dost thou lament at the grief or loss of a friend,
when thou art so friendless in thyself. Being thrown alone
in this world, whom dost thou claim as a friend of thy soul?</p>

<p class='c009'>19. We see only the particles of matter of which this body
is composed; it exists and passes away in its time from its
place; but there is no rising or falling of the soul.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>20. Being imperishable in thyself, why dost thou fear to fall
into naught? And why think of the destruction of thy soul,
which is never subject to death?</p>

<p class='c009'>21. When a jar is broken in twain from its upper part, its
vacuity is not lost, but mixes with the air; so the body being
destroyed, the indestructible soul is not lost with it (but
unites with its original source).</p>

<p class='c009'>22. As the sunlight causing the appearance of a river in the
mirage, is not lost at the disappearance of the phenomenal
river; so the immortal soul does not perish upon dissolution
of the frail body.</p>

<p class='c009'>23. There is a certain illusion, which raises the false appetites
within us; otherwise the unity of the soul requires the help
of no duality or secondary substance, in order to be united
with the sole unity.</p>

<p class='c009'>24. There is no sensible object, whether visible, tangible,
audible or of taste or smelling (which relate to the particular
senses and brain), that can affect the unconnected soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>25. All things and their powers, are contained in the all-powerful
and all-comprehensive soul; these powers are displayed
throughout the world, but the soul is as void as the empty air.</p>

<p class='c009'>26. It is the mental deception, O Rághava, that presents before
it the phenomena of the triple world, representing diverse forms
according to the triplicate nature of man (the <i>satva</i>, <i>rajas</i>
and <i>tamas</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>27. There are threefold methods of dispelling this delusion of
the mind, namely: by the tranquility of the mind, by destroying
its desires, and by abandonment of acts (which lead only to errors
in our repeated regenerations).</p>

<p class='c009'>28. The world is a crushing mill, with its lower and upper
stones of the earth and heaven; our desires are the cords that
incessantly drag us under it: therefore Ráma, break off these
ropes (and you will escape the danger of being crushed by it).</p>

<p class='c009'>29. Our unacquaintance with spiritual knowledge, is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>cause of all our errors; but our acquaintance of it,
leads us to endless joy and ultimately to Brahma himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>30. The living being having proceeded from Brahma, and
travelled over the earth at pleasure, turns at last to
Brahma by means of his knowledge of Him.</p>

<p class='c009'>31. Ráma! all things have sprung from one Being, who is perfect
felicity itself, inconceivable and undecaying in its nature;
and all these are as the rays of that light, or as the light
of that everlasting fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>32. These are as lines on the leaves of trees, and as the curls
and waves on the surface of waters. They are as ornaments made
of that gold, and as the heat and cold of that fire and water.</p>

<p class='c009'>33. Thus the triple world subsists in the thought of the
Divine mind. It has thus sprung from the mind of God, and
rests in its self-same state with the all-comprehending mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>34. This Mind is called Brahma, who is the soul of all existence.
He being known the world is known also (<i>i.e.</i>, the world
is known through him); and as he is the knower of all, he gives
us the knowledge of all things. (Thus the Sruti:—There is no
knowing of anything but by the knowledge that He imparts
to us).</p>

<p class='c009'>35. This all-pervasive Being is explained to us by the learned,
by the coined epithets of the soul, intellect and Brahma, used
both in the sástras as in the popular language.</p>

<p class='c009'>36. The pure notion that we have of an everlasting Being, apart
from all sensible ideas and impressions, is called the Intellect
and soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>37. This Intellect or Intelligent soul, is much more transparent
than the etherial sky; and it is the plenum, that contains the
plenitude of the world, as a disjoined and distinct reflexion
of itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>38. The knowledge of the separate existence of the unreal reflexion
of the world, apart from that real reflector, is the cause of all
our ignorance and error; but the view of their subsistence in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>mirror of the supreme soul, blends them all to myself also (who
are the same soul).</p>

<p class='c009'>39. Now Ráma, that hast a bodiless soul of the form of pure
intellect, thou canst have no cause to fall into the error,
of being sorry for or afraid of the vanities of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>40. How can the unembodied soul be affected by the passions
and feelings of the body? It is the ignorant and unintelligent
only, that are subject to vain suspicions about unrealities.</p>

<p class='c009'>41. The indestructible intellect of the unintelligent even, is
not destroyed by the destruction of their bodies, how then
should the intelligent be afraid of their dissolution?</p>

<p class='c009'>42. The intellect is irresistible in its course, and roves about
the solar path (ecliptic); it is the intellectual part that makes
the man, and not the outward body. (Puri sete purushah; it is
the inner soul that is called man).</p>

<p class='c009'>43. The soul called the <i>purusha</i> or inner person, whether it
abideth in the body or not, and whether it is intelligent or
otherwise (rational or irrational), never dies upon the death
of the body.</p>

<p class='c009'>44. Whatever miseries you meet with, Ráma! in this transient
world, all appertain to the body, and not to the intangible
soul or intellect.</p>

<p class='c009'>45. The intellectual soul being removed from the region of
the mind (which is but an inward sense, and of the nature
of vacuity, and not the grains of the brain composing the mind),
is not to be approached by the pleasures and pains affecting
the body and mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>46. The soul that has curbed its earthly desires, flies to its
seat in the spirit of Brahma, after the dissolution of its prison house
of the body; in the same manner as the bee lying hid
under the coverlet of the lotus petals in the darkness of the
night, takes to its heavenward flight by the dawning light of
the day.</p>

<p class='c009'>47. If life is known to be frail, and the living state to be a
transient scene, then say, O Ráma! what it is that is lost by loss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>of this prison-house of the body, and what is it that you mourn for?</p>

<p class='c009'>48. Think therefore, O Ráma! on the nature of truth; and
mind not about the errors of ignorance. Be freed from your
earthly desires, and know the sinless soul to be void of all
desires.</p>

<p class='c009'>49. The intellectual soul being tranquil and transparent, and
a mere witness of our doings, without any doing or desire of
its own, receives the reflexion of the undesirous God, as a
mirror reflects the images of things.</p>

<p class='c009'>50. The soul being, as said before, a translucent particle,
reflects the images of all worlds in itself; as a polished
gem reflects the rays of light in its bosom.</p>

<p class='c009'>51. The relation of the indifferent soul with the world, is
like that of the mirror and its reflexions; the difference and
identity of the soul and the world, are of the same kind.</p>

<p class='c009'>52. As the activities of living beings, have a free play with
the rising sun; so the duties of the world, are fully discharged
by the rising of the intellect.</p>

<p class='c009'>53. No sooner you get rid of your error of the substantiality
of the world, than you shall come to the consciousness of its
being a vacuum, resting in the spirit of God (which is the
receptacle of infinite space, and whatever there appears in it).</p>

<p class='c009'>54. As it is the nature of a lighted lamp to spread its lustre
all around, so it is the nature of mental philosophy, to enlighten
us with the real state of the soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>55. The essence of the supreme soul gave rise to the mind (will)
at first, which spread out the universe with its net work
of endless varieties. It was as the sky issuing out of the
infinite vacuity, and assuming the shape of the blue atmosphere
which is also a nullity.</p>

<p class='c009'>56. Privation of desires melts down the mind, and dissolves
the mist of ignorance from the face of the intellect. Then
appears the bright light of the one infinite and increate God,
like the clear firmament of autumn after the dispersion of
clouds.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>57. The mind sprouts out at first from the supreme soul with all
its activities, and takes upon it the nature of the lotus-born
Brahmá by its desire of creation. It stretches out a variety
of worlds by its creative will, which are also as the fancied
apparitions, appearing before the imaginations of deluded boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>58. Non-entity appears as an entity before us, it dies away
at death, and reappears with our new birth. The mind itself
takes its rise from the divine intellect, and displays itself
in the substance of the Divine Soul, as the waves play about
on the surface of the waters of the deep.</p>

<p><a href='#r1' class="label">[1]</a> The reader is referred to the following passage in the story of Rip Van
Winkle in Irving’s Sketch-Book. “To him the whole twenty years, had
been but as one night”. The strange events that had taken place during
his torpor were, that there had been a revolutionary war, when his
country had thrown off the yoke of old England, and that instead of
being a subject of George the third, he was now a free citizen of
the United States, pp. 32-33.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p><a href='#r2' class="label">[2]</a> The intuition of his existence, is the best proof of the same. Sruti.

I then looked within myself, and saw him there—as his seat was there.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p><a href='#r3' class="label">[3]</a> Activity is attended with the pleasure of enjoyment, with the pain of
bondage; and inactivity with the pleasure of freedom, and the pain
of poverty. The insensible are fond of fruition at the expense of
their freedom; but the wise prefer their liberty with poverty, as
it is said in the <i>Upanishad</i>:—</p>

<p>  श्रयोहि पुंसामाधकं बृणोते । प्रयोमन्दीयोग क्षेमादधिकं बृणोते ।
</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p><a href='#r4' class="label">[4]</a> The black Rákshasas were believed to have been a colony of African
Negroes in southern India and Ceylon. The Rakhs is Rax, as Sycorax of
Shakespeare.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Note</i>:—The whole story of the fiendish Súchí is an allegory of
the human mind, and its rapacity. The transformation of the huge to
the thin pinnate body, and again its assumption of the big form, are
allegorical of the change of the corporeal and spiritual bodies—the
<i>Sthúla</i> and <i>Súkshma</i> saríras, in the course of the repeated
transmigrations of the soul from its gross to subtle forms by the
desire of the mind. Tired of the world the mind forsakes the gross
body upon death, and assumes the finer spiritual form, but being
soon dissatisfied with it reverts to its former gross form again.
It is also explained to be the two states of <i>animá</i> and <i>garimá</i>,
the minuteness and bulkiness, which the <i>Yogi</i> attains by his <i>yoga</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p><a href='#r5' class="label">[5]</a> It is a curious fact in the theological works of Vedánta, that
princes and ladies, employed themselves much more to the cultivation
of their minds, and to the investigation of mental and spiritual
Philosophy, than other persons and tribes. So we see Surúchi, Lílá,
Visúchí and Sarasvatí were all female interlocutors in this work
and some Upanishads also, though female education was subsequently
abrogated by law.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p><a href='#r6' class="label">[6]</a> <i>Samvitti</i> is the superior or subjective consciousness
personified as Viráj, and <i>samvid</i> or inferior consciousness
of the objective as received in the personification of Viswa. Here
Schelling says:—The absolute infinite cannot be known in personal
or objective consciousness; but requires a superior faculty called
the intuition.</p>

<p class='c009'>The joint knowledge of the subjective and objective is had by Ecstasy,
which discerns the identity of the subject and object in a series of
souls which are as the innumerable individual eyes, which the infinite
World-spirit behold, in it-self, Lewis Hist. Phil. II. 580.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p><a href='#r7' class="label">[7]</a> So says a spiritualistic philosopher. Think you this earth of ours
is a lifeless and unsentient bulk, while the worm on her surface
is in the enjoyment of life? No, the universe is not dead. This
life—jíva, what is it but the pervading afflux of deific love and
life, vivifying all nature, and sustaining the animal and vegetable
world as well as the world of mind? These suns, systems, planets
and satellites, are not mere mechanisms. The pulsations of a divine
life throb in them all, and make them rich in the sense that they
too are parts of the divine cosmos. Should it be objected that it
proves too much; that it involves the identity of the vital principle
of animals and vegetables, let us not shrink from the conclusion.
The essential unity of all spirit and all life with this exuberant
life from God, is a truth from which we need not recoil, even
though it bring all animal and vegetable forms within the sweep of
immortality. Epes Sargent.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p><a href='#r8' class="label">[8]</a> The unity of all phenomena was the dream of ancient philosophy. To
reduce all this multiplicity to a single principle, has been and
continues to be the ever recurring problem. To the question of a
unity of substance the Greek science, repeatedly applied itself;
and so did the sophists of Persia and India. It was the craving
for unity, which led the white men of Asia, the ancient Aryan
race, to the conception of God as the one substance immanent in
the universe. At first they were polytheists, but with the progress
of thought their number of gods diminished, and became the authors
of Veda. At last arrived to the conception of a unity of forces,
of a divine power as the ultimate substratum of things. They
regarded the beings of the world, as in effect, composed of two
elements; the one real and of a nature permanent and absolute,
and the other relative, flowing and variable and phenomenal;
the one spirit and the other matter, and both proceeding from
an inseparable unity, a single substance. Ibid. According to
Vásishtha this single substance is the <i>chit</i> or divine
intelligence, which produces the Mind, which is conversant with
matter.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p><a href='#r9' class="label">[9]</a> Note. The powers of the Intellect are, perception, memory,
imagination and judgment. Ego is the subject of thoughts,
or the subjective and really existent being. The personal
God Brahmá is an emanation of God according to the Gnostics,
and is like the Demiurgus of Plato next to God and soul of
the world. Plotinus.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p><a href='#r10' class="label">[10]</a> The allegory of the three spheres, means no more than the triple
state of man, as a spiritual, an intellectual and a physical or
corporeal being. The intellectual state in the text, is properly
the spiritual and highest state of a human being. The mental is
next to the intellectual or midmost state of man, and the physical
or corporeal state, is the lowest condition, in which the elevated
nature of humanity is subjected like an inferior animal, to grovel
upon the earth.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p><a href='#r11' class="label">[11]</a> Compare the adventure of the prince Tájul Malur in Guli Bakáwalí,
and his bearing the burthen of his children by the Negro wife on
his shoulders.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p><a href='#r12' class="label">[12]</a> The Text uses the terms <i>jnána</i> and <i>ajnána</i>, which literally
signify knowledge and ignorance, and mean to say that, we know the
subjective ourselves only (as-ego-sum) and are ignorant of the true
nature of the objective, as whether they are or not and what they are.
Though it would be more appropriate to use the words nischaya and
anischaya or certainty and uncertainty, because we are certain of
our own existence, and are quite uncertain of every thing besides,
which we perceive in our triple states of waking, dreaming and
sound sleep, which incessantly produce and present before us a
vast variety
of objects, all of which lead us to error by their false appearances.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p><a href='#r13' class="label">[13]</a> All things existent in the Divine mind in their eternally ideal state,
present the same ideas to our minds also, which are of the similar
nature and substance with the Divine.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
